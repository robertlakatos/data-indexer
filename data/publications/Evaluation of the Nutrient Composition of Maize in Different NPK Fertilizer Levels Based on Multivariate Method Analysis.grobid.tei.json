FAO 490) during the growing season with six-level nitrogen fertilisation supplies at five phenological stages. e study included essential nutrients as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), and sulphur (S) (in first cluster) and calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) (in second cluster) in treatments on different leaf stage. Growth stages have different nutrient demands based on their actual demand. e first cluster included nitrogen and sulphur and the second included calcium and zinc in the NPK treatments on the stalk of plants. Nitrogen and potassium had their maximum effect on the stalk of maize during the growing season. Magnesium and copper were the second most important and desirable factors during the different growth stages and treatments in relation to the stalk. Nitrogen and calcium had their maximum impact during the yield formation stage and nitrogen and phosphorus had their most desirable effect during the grain filling stage. e effect of nitrogen on the quantitative and qualitative properties of maize showed that nitrogen increases the production of dry matter, grain yield, and its components. e maximum amount of absorption in the plants occurs before the accumulation of applied fertiliser, which is the prelude to the production of maximum biomass.",
