          "text": "Understanding the physiological factors which allow or constrain maize (Zea mays L.) recovery from vegetative N stress when N fertilizer is added near flowering is important for N management decisions. To study the capacity of maize to recover from vegetative N stress, we conducted a two-year experiment comparing seven hybrids (released between 1946 and 2015) and five N treatments -a 0 N control (0_0) and four treatments which received a total of 220 kg N ha -1 applied either 100% at V4 (220_0), 100% at R1 (0_220), 75% at V4 and 25% at R1 (165_55), or 25% at V4 and 75% at R1 (55_165). These N treatments created a range of N deficiencies at flowering. There was no indication that yield response to the timing of N application had changed over the past 70 years of hybrid improvement. Compared to 220_0, grain yield was significantly lowered by the delayed application of 0_220 (relative yield of 89%) but not by the split applications of 55_165 or 165_55 (relative yields of 93 and 100%, respectively), although both 0_220 and 55_165 were under N stress at R1, as indicated by the N Nutrition Index. The reasons for the lower grain yield in 0_220, but not 55_165, appeared to be 1) low vegetativestage N accumulation which could not be compensated for by increased post-silking N uptake, 2) lack of recovery of leaf N status following the R1 N application, and 3) significantly reduced biomass accumulation during the vegetative growth. These findings provide a better understanding of the ability of maize to recover from moderate early-season N stress and will aid agronomists in making management decisions regarding the timing of N fertilizer applications.",

          "text": "In order to improve N fertilizer management decisions in maize (Zea mays L.), the physiological constraints on N uptake during the postsilking period after low N availability during the vegetative growth stages warrants investigation. Previous research has generally found maize grain yield to be insensitive to the timing of N application during vegetative growth stages where moderate N levels can be provided by soil N mineralization (Jokela and Randall, 1997;Scharf et al., 2002;Kitchen et al., 2017;Mueller et al., 2017). However, there has been little research on the physiological mechanisms which underlie and control maize recovery from early-season N stress. This is of particular interest in areas, such as the Midwestern United States, which often experience excess spring precipitation (Wang et al., 2016) that may prevent early-season N applications (pre-plant or sidedress), cause substantial loss of applied N through leaching or denitrification, or create conditions conducive to minimal soil N mineralization.",

          "text": "Maximum, or nearly maximum, yields have been obtained even when N applications were delayed until the late-vegetative growth stages (defined here as V12 or later) in locations with adequate soil N mineralization. In a series of 28 experiments, Scharf et al. (2002) found no negative impacts on yield when the total N application was delayed until V11, and only minor yield losses when application was delayed until V12 or V16. Although delaying the entire N application until R1 lowered relative yields to 71-95% of maximum yield, there was still a very strong agronomic benefit to N application at the R1 stage. These observations confirmed the findings of Binder et al. (2000) who investigated an extensive combination of N rates, ratios of early to late applied N, and timings of split N applications. Those authors established that by applying N as late as R1, maximum yield could be obtained in treatments that otherwise would have developed N deficiency during the grain filling period. However, in the same study, final yield was significantly lowered when the full rate of N application was delayed until R3.",

          "text": "A larger impact of the timing of N availability on grain yield has been demonstrated when very severe N deficiencies during specific periods of crop growth could be implemented. In a pot experiment, Subedi and Ma (2005) found that when N was withheld from planting to V8 or from V8 to R6, there were significant reductions in grain yield compared to plants with a continuous supply of N. However, when N was withheld only after R1, there was no negative effect on yield. These results highlight that extreme N stress during the time of floral initiation (around V8) can significantly reduce potential kernel number. Also, because peak N accumulation occurs during V10-R1 (Russelle et al., 1983;DeBruin et al., 2017), an inability to accumulate N during this time was detrimental to yield, but the lack of soil N after R1 had no effect. Pearson and Jacobs (1987) had similar findings in a field experiment on very sandy soil (96% sand) using frequent irrigation (every 1-3 days). Those authors also found that N supply during the period of spikelet initiation had the greatest effect on yield, while supplying N during the grain filling period increased grain N concentration by 1.3fold but not grain yield. It should be emphasized that both Subedi and Ma (2005) and Pearson and Jacobs (1987) were able to achieve very rapid soil N depletion, and therefore also severe N stress, during targeted periods of the growing season. Maize grown across the U.S. Corn Belt is normally not subject to such extremes due to substantial soil N mineralization.",

          "text": "The quantity and timing of N accumulation in maize is a key concern because of the strong relationship between crop N accumulation and crop dry matter production. Nitrogen deficiency has been shown to reduce both leaf area and leaf N concentration, therefore reducing light capture and photosynthetic capacity (Vos et al., 2005). Furthermore, low biomass accumulation during the vegetative growth may also limit grain yield as harvest index has been shown to be fairly stable in maize (Duvick, 2005). Lastly, limits in crop growth rate during the critical period may lower established kernel number (Andrade et al., 1999) while N deficiency during the grain filling period causes reduction in kernel weight (Borr√°s and Otegui, 2001).",

          "text": "The timing of N application may impact other aspects crop development besides final yield, such as the source of grain N. The N needed to support kernel growth and grain yield originates from both remobilization of N taken up during the vegetative growth and N accumulated during the post-silking period (Christensen et al., 1981;Cliquet et al., 1990;Ta and Weiland, 1992;Moll et al., 1994;Ciampitti and Vyn, 2013;Chen et al., 2015a). Relative contributions of these two sources to grain N vary with management and environment; however, in a review Mueller and Vyn (2016) found that 57% of the grain N could be attributed to post-silking N uptake in hybrids released since 1991. Generally, post-silking N and N remobilization appear to have an inverse relationship (Pan et al., 1984(Pan et al., , 1995;;Coque and Gallais, 2007), but studies which prevented pollination have shown that high rates of post-silking N uptake occurred even when the sink was effectively removed (Pan et al., 1995;Yang et al., 2016). This suggests that postsilking N may be more strongly controlled by soil N availability than by crop N demand.",

          "text": "There is reason to believe modern hybrids may respond differently than older hybrids to the timing of N fertilizer application. It is known that there are genotypic differences in the timing of N accumulation (Beauchamp et al., 1976;Ma and Dwyer, 1998). Furthermore, there has been substantial evidence that modern hybrids accumulate more total N, and more N during the post-silking period (Mi et al., 2003;Ciampitti and Vyn, 2012;Haegele et al., 2013;Chen et al., 2015a;Woli et al., 2017). This increase in total N accumulation has likely contributed to the 4-fold increase in grain yields that have occurred in the United States since the 1930's (Duvick, 2005). Other sources of increased grain yield have been related to improved resilience to stresses such as high plant population, drought, and low soil N (McCullough et al., 1994;Byrne et al., 1995;Tollenaar and Lee, 2002;Reyes et al., 2015;DeBruin et al., 2017).",

However, in genotypes released prior to 1990, there was no change in %PostN with increased R1 N stress. Based on this, the authors concluded that the ability to continue to accumulate N post-silking, if N fertilizer becomes available, may be another mode of increased resilience to stress in modern maize hybrids.",

The experiment was rain-fed and managed in a maize-soybean (Glycine max L.) rotation. A split-plot design was used with N treatment as the main plot and hybrid as the sub-plot with three replications. To establish a range of N stress levels at R1, N treatments included a 0 N control (0_0) with no N application and a conventional treatment of 220 kg N ha -1 all applied as a V4 sidedress (220_0, high control). Three additional N treatments all received a total of 220 kg N fertilizer ha -1 applied either at V4 and/or R1. These treatments were: 0 kg N applied at V4 and 220 kg N applied at R1 (0_220), 55 kg N applied at V4 and 165 kg N applied at R1 (55_165), and 165 kg N applied at V4 and 55 kg N applied at R1 (165_55). A total N rate of 220 kg N ha -1 was used to ensure that the final N rate was not yield limiting (Camberato and Nielsen, 2017). Seven hybrids were included representing a subset of the DuPont Pioneer ERA hybrids (DeBruin et al., 2017) plus an additional more recent hybrid. Hybrids used in this experiment were (year of release): 352HYB (1946352HYB ( ), 354A (1958352HYB ( ), 3390 (1967352HYB ( ), 3382 (1976352HYB ( ), 3335 (1995352HYB ( ), 34N42 (2003352HYB ( ), and P1311 (2015)). Hybrids will subsequently be referred to by their year of release. All hybrids were similar in crop relative maturity (111-114 days) and were planted at a common seeding rate resulting in an average established plant density of 78,500 plants ha -1 . Although this density is above the common plant population used at the time of commercialization for many of these hybrids, a single \"modern-era\" plant population has been used in several other ERA studies (Campos et al., 2006;Haegele et al., 2013;Reyes et al., 2015).",

Whole-canopy leaf N concentrations declined between R1 and R2 (data not shown) and at the latter R2 biomass sampling, leaf N concentrations for the entire canopy were significantly lower in 0_220 and 55_165 (1.8 and 2.0%, respectively), compared to 220_0 and 165_55 (average of 2.2%).

The limited vegetative N accumulation in 0_220 and 55_165 lowered the remobilized N reserves and increased dependence on post-silking N uptake to meet grain Nc demand. Review studies have suggested that across a wide range of genotypes and environments 27-39% of the N accumulated by R1 is remobilized and that 43-44% of grain Nc arises from remobilized N (Ciampitti and Vyn, 2013;Mueller and Vyn, 2016).

The lack of vegetative N available for remobilization increased the proportion of grain Nc which originated from post-silking N accumulation from 33% in 220_0 to 71% in 0_220 (Fig. 5), demonstrating that this was a very strong sink for post-silking N uptake.",

In that synthesis review, as R1 N stress increased (indicated by R1 NNI), the proportion of the total N accumulated post-silking (% PostN) increased in genotypes released after 1991, but not in genotypes released prior to 1990. In the present study, the %PostN increased with R1 N application rate from about 22% in 0_0, 220_0 and 165_55 to 35% in 55_165 and 47% in 0_220, but this trend did not change with hybrid improvement (data not shown).

For the seven hybrids compared, representing 70 years of maize improvement, there was little difference in grain yield response to the timing of N application. In this experiment, there was no yield penalty for delaying the last 25 (165_55) or 75% (55_165) of a non-limiting N rate until R1 compared to 100% of the N being applied at V4 (220_0). However, delaying 100% of the N application until R1 (0_220) resulted in significantly lower grain yields. Both 0_220 and 55_165 were shown to be under N stress at R1 as indicated by NNI values of 0.65 and 0.83, respectively. However, relative grain yields plateaued at an R1 NNI equal to 0.8, indicating that maize can tolerate moderate levels of vegetative N stress if additional N becomes available by R1 to meet grain N demand during the post-silking period. We suggest that the reduction in grain yield in 0_220, but not in 55_165, was due to low vegetativestage N accumulation which could not be compensated for by increased post-silking N uptake, lack of leaf N recovery following the R1 N application, and significantly lower vegetative-stage biomass accumulation. These findings provide a better understanding of the ability of maize to recover from a moderate early-season N stress and will aid agronomists in making management decisions regarding the timing of N fertilizer applications and the utility of \"rescue\" N applications.",
