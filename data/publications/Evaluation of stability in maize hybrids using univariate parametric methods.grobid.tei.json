Interaction of genotype × environment and make the more accurate selection, the performance and stability of hybrids need to be considered simultaneously. This study aimed to investigate stable genotypes with yield using 12 maize hybrids in different climatic conditions of Iran. The experimental design used was a randomized complete blocks design in three replications in two cropping years in Karaj, Birjand, Shiraz, and Arak stations. The simple analysis of variance performed on grain yield of genotypes indicated that all hybrids studied each year and station were significantly different in grain yield. Also, the combined analysis results showed a significant effect on the environment, the effects of genotype, and the interaction of genotype × environment and t in the studied hybrids different. Comparing Duncan's mean on the data obtained from the research, KSC705 genotypes with an average yield of 7.21 and KSC704 genotype with an average yield of 7.04 were identified as high yield cultivars. In order to identify stable cultivars, six stability parameters were used. KSC260 and KSC707 genotypes had stability Based on the environmental variance, also had stability based KSC705, KSC707 genotype on environmental the coefficient of variation, and KSC260 genotypes had stability based methods of genotype and environment interaction. As well as based on Eberhart and Russell regression coefficient had the stability to KSC400 and SC647 genotypes. Also, they were identified as the most stable genotypes based on the detection coefficient method, KSC707, and KSC703 genotypes.",

Due to the increase in the area under maize cultivation in recent years in Iran and achieving high yields per unit area, it is necessary to study the reaction of new hybrids in different regions and years to identify the best genotypes after removing the interaction between genotype and environment and be introduced as high-yielding cultivars (Choukan et al. 2005;Illés et al. 2020;Bojtor et al. 2021).",

          "text": "Inbreeding programs, genotypes should be evaluated in a wide range of environmental variation in different places and years to provide information from estimating compatibility and yield stability of genotypes as a more reliable criterion in recommending cultivars and developing their cultivation, and increasing the efficiency of selection and introduction (Khajeh Ahmad Attari. 1989). The concept of stability was first used in regional performance tests in 1917 (Scapim et al. 2000;Berzsenyi et al. 2007). Parametric methods of genotype response to the environment were considered a one-variable relationship. All univariate methods tried to justify the genotype response to the environment by calculating a stable index. Therefore, a particular genotype may be identified as stable in one assessment and unstable and may not produce the same result. The main reason for this is that the response of genotypes to the environment is a multivariate relationship and cannot be justified by a single stability index (Jadhav et al. 2019;Lin et al., 1986;Lidansky et al. 1998). Lin et al. (1986) divided parametric conservation methods into three types: Type I: A stable genotype with slight variance between environments. Type II: A stable genotype whose response to environments is parallel to the total responses of genotypes to the environment. Type III is a stable genotype in which the remaining of the regression model is small on its environmental index. In the study of 20 barley genotypes by Bahrami et al. 2008, some of these methods, such as calculating environmental variance, were used to calculate the coefficient of variation by Eberhart and Russell's method identified stable genotypes. In another study investigating durum wheat genotypes, various univariate parametric methods such as regression coefficient, the sum of squares, deviation from Eberhart and Russell regression line, detection coefficient, Shukla stability variance, Wrick's equivalence, and environmental variance. Finally, two genotypes were introduced as the most stable genotypes (Becker et al.1988;Akcura et al. 2006). Shukla stability variance (i2δ) and Wrick's equivalence (Wi2) statistics indicate the type II stability of Lin et al. (1986). Hayward et al. (1993) have three factors: genotype, environmental effect, and interaction together. Genotype and environment were implicated in the occurrence of a phenotype. Also, they believed that the genotype in environment interaction reduces phenotypic and genotypic value and may lead to the selection of individuals from one environment that perform poorly in other environments.",

This analysis showed that the KSC705 genotype with an average yield of 7.21 (t\\h) and KSC704 genotype with an average yield of 7.04 (t\\h) had the highest average yield. SC301, SC302, and KSC260 genotypes with average yields of 4.8(t\\h), 4.9(t\\h), and 4.54 (t\\h) had the lowest mean yields among hybrids. Although the above methods have some similarities in introducing stable genotypes, differences in introducing genotypes indicate that the results of the above parameters are not entirely consistent. A nonparametric method presented the criterion of total rank for the simultaneous selection of stable and maximum yielding genotypes in yield rank and Shukla stability variance rank. In this method, a genotype with the highest yield is ranked first, and a genotype with the lowest variance value is ranked first. Then, yield rank and variance rank for each genotype are added together, and this sum is used as a statistic to determine the stable genotype. In this method, a genotype is stable that has the least amount of sum (Pinto et al. 2019).",
