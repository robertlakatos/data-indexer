The study site was at the University of Debrecen's Látókép Experiment Station in Hungary. The date of emergence of the tested maize hybrids was monitored under control (0 kg N ha -1 ), 120 kg ha -1 N + PK, and 300 kg ha -1 N + PK nutrient levels in a long-term field experiment. In 2020, maize hybrids (H1 = FAO 490; H2: FAO 420-440; H3 = FAO 420; H4 = 490; H5 = 320-340; H6 = FAO 350-370) growing under natural precipitation supply conditions without irrigation were included in the study. During the days of emergence, different moisture, protein, oil, starch, and yield production levels were observed, according to the variance analysis. In diverse maize hybrids, increasing or decreasing fertilizer treatment resulted in diverse productivity metrics. Regression analysis revealed that the day of emergence had a greater impact on protein, moisture, starch, and oil content than N fertilizer; however, yield production was influenced by N fertilization, rather than day of emergence. Regarding productivity parameters, this study suggests that H1 has the best productivity until the fourth day of emergence.",

          "text": "Today, the pressure on populations is increasing due to ever-increasing social and living standards and the demand for land for industrial investment activities . The growing vigor in demand for maize also shows that this diversified plant plays a major role in the food processing industry . In terms of maize cultivation technology, an evolving trend has emerged over the last decade. It is necessary to use hybrids that are resistant to external factors in extreme weather. An expanding hybrid palette is available for farmers. Site-specific crop production needs to be implemented in a way that is optimally adapted to production objectives and ecological conditions; the production process is affected by site-specific nitrogen application, and significant positive yields have been obtained with the help of soil moisture monitoring systems under irrigated conditions . In this study have been carried out to understand the effects of stress on the germination and emergence of plants . However, it should be mentioned that there is a close relationship between the response of plants to stress and the germination vigor of seeds . According to Macaloney et al. , the maize germination process is divided into three stages: first stage: the swelling of the grains, abundant water uptake; second stage: the elongation of existing cells; third stage: the division of meristem cells. Murungu et al. , according to their experiment, stated that soils with finer soil grains have better seed-to-soil grain contact, i.e., faster water uptake and germination. As a result of physical soil tests, the water holding, water absorption, and water conductivity capacities of soils can be determined. The physical diversity of each soil can also be inferred from its ability to supply and store nutrients. The mechanical (grain) composition of the soil is the ratio of individual particles of different sizes to each other; this ratio largely determines water and nutrient management and other physical and chemical properties of the soil . Some of the precipitation seeps into the soil, so the soil moisture is partly adhered to the soil particles and partly present in the gaps between the particles. Seed and plants can utilize this water in the gaps between soil grains . Rapid germination affects the emergence of a homogeneous stock, which can be achieved under better conditions. Fast and even germination is the most important factor for successful crop production, while germination problems appear due to slow, uneven, unreliable germination, and seeds with low germination vigor . Low post-sowing temperatures (8-12 • C) have a negative effect on the physiological activity of germinating maize seeds, also affecting the various organisms in the soil which promote germination . A positive correlation between seed size and total oil content can be detected along with germination vigor. Chemical analyses suggested that both lower stearic-and oleic acid in the seed and high levels of linoleic acid in the seed were also effective for spring germination. These traits are characteristic of genotypes with strong growth potential at the beginning of the germination period, even under frequent cool conditions . During the growth of the maize plant, the critical stages are germination and emergence, which also affect the quality and quantity of yield . Soil water content is a key factor in seed germination and seedling emergence in semi-arid areas . Optimizing the sowing date has a positive effect on maize yield and adaptation to changing conditions. The results of the performed experiment revealed the effect of grain yield on the starch content and protein and oil production in one hectare . The number of days from sowing to emergence (NDSSE) is one of the most important agronomic traits in the cultivation of maize (Zea mays L.), which is also reflected in the obtained yield . At germination, the primary root is part of the whole root system, followed by the seminal roots, mesocotylborne roots, the crown and finally the brace roots to acquire water, NO 3 -, NH 4 + , P, and K . Schneider and Gupta  conclude in their experiment that soil moisture sufficiently satisfied the water capacity of the field, and average soil temperature was the most strongly determining factor influencing germination time, when aggregate size was between 1.0 and 6.8 mm. Sowing is considered to be the first critical and most sensitive part of a plant's life cycle, and seeds are often exposed to adverse environmental effects that pose a threat to plant germination . Sun et al.  emphasized that root growth-even at this early stage-responded to the low N content applied, indicating that this method could be used with a high-permeability phenotype maize germplasm under laboratory conditions. Based on statistical analysis of the data, the days to appearance were not significantly (p > 0.05) affected by N and P fertilizers. The maximum number of days (9 days) was recorded for short growing season hybrids, i.e., FAO 400-500 and local varieties. The minimum was recorded for FAO 400-500 hybrids. The number of days to emergence was recorded after treatment with N + PK at 100 kg ha -1 . The effect of N + PK (150:150) did not appear until a few days had passed. The combined effect of cultivars and NP levels had a non-significant (p > 0.05) effect on the days until emergence due to the fact that the seeds have their own nutrient reserves and do not need an external energy source . N-fertilization was the most influential factor for the number of seeds per m 2 . Kernel weight was lowest in the N0 (0 kg ha -1 N) control treatment and was significantly higher in the N60 (60 kg ha -1 N) and N120 (120 kg ha -1 N) treatments . The appearance of seedlings was not homogeneous at 150:120 N:P doses. The efficiency of nitrogen utilization was moderate under the effect of the high nitrogen dose. At the low N dose, the incorporation of N into the plant was better detected. A safer emergence was achieved at a dose of 90:90 kg N:P ha -1 . Hussain  reported that 100 kg N ha -1 resulted in complete, homogeneous germination of maize, thereby stimulating plant growth and also positively influencing yield. Siddique et al.  investigated the effect of increasing doses of N treatments (0, 56, 84, 112 kg ha -1 ) on the quantity and quality of maize yields. It was concluded that increasing N doses had a positive effect on yield and crude protein content. Several researchers (in Látókép, Debrecen, east of Hungary and Kincaid, Haven, KS, USA) put forward that, in the case of harmonic NPK macronutrient fertilization, the nutrient intake per 100 kg ha -1 of maize grain yield is lower than in the case of unilateral fertilization (N, P, and K separately) . The heterogeneity of emergence dynamics was compared with yield and quality. The main aim of the experiment was to clarify the effect of nitrogen and the maturity group of the hybrids for the emergency vigor and yield parameters in a long-term field experiment.",

Seed germination is a complex and dynamic stage of plant growth, which can improve yield production . Abbasian et al.  examined the germination and seedling emergence of maize and stated that seedling emergence indices in the field did not significantly correlate with the standard germination test. The seedling growth analysis test involves measuring seedlings' length and dry weight in the standard germination test, which is used as a test for the vigor of seeds and seedlings . Regression analysis showed that the day of emergence had a more pronounced effect than N fertilizer on protein, moisture, starch, and oil content. In addition, N fertilizer treatment had a more pronounced effect than day of emergence on grain yield. In this case, it can be concluded that the effect of N fertilizer and day of emergence together can be more pronounced on productivity parameters. Therefore, the applied N fertilizer could have a maximum effect on the day of emergence to harvesting time and yield. Nitrogen is a fundamental nutrient that enhances plant growth and greenness. Nitrogen reserves of the main root probably affect the rapid recovery of the plant due to defoliation . This study showed that FAO 490 (H1) has maximum productivity from the first day to the fourth day of emergence on productivity parameters. FAO 350-370 showed excellent productivity after the fourth day of emergence with increasing N fertilizer doses. FAO 420-440 and FAO 420 had the best productivity from the first day to the sixth day of emergence. H8 showed maximum productivity from the third day to the sixth day of emergence with increasing fertilizer levels. In the case of this hybrid, the first day to the third day of emergence did not have a more pronounced effect on yield parameters. In general, the highest maize grain yields were achieved at early and optimal sowing times, resulting in significant yield reductions in late and very late sowing. Hybrids with higher FAO numbers had much higher grain yields than the early maturity group hybrids . At the time of harvesting, sowing time had the greatest effect on grain moisture content. Based on the sowing date × hybrid interaction, it could be concluded that the grain moisture content increased in the higher FAO hybrids to a greater extent late or very late compared to lower FAO hybrids . Sowing maize earlier resulted in larger crops and improved yield production, while crops sown later were smaller and had reduced yields. Yield reduction is often due to non-uniform density in the field; thus, researchers have investigated the effect of non-uniform density on yield by simulating different crop densities and using different crop dates . In addition, some researchers have reported that the application of nitrogen fertilizer at 100 kg/ha compared to non-use of fertilizer causes an increase in average yield and day of emergence . The decrease in grain yield and growth characteristics of the Sc. 301 hybrid maize was stated to be due to the reduced emergence and establishment of seedlings with weak vigor. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of the size and shapes of different seed masses of the Sc. 704 hybrid maize, with an initial germination percentage of 1, 2, and 2% broad, medium, and round seed mass, on some characteristics of seedlings .",

Nitrogen fertilizer had a significant effect on the days of emergence by improving nutrient conditions for the germination of maize. Maize hybrids show a different trend in emergence dynamics depending on nitrogen fertilizer treatments, which farmers should consider. In this study, FAO 420-440 presented the highest percentage of emerged maize crops, resulting in higher stability.",
