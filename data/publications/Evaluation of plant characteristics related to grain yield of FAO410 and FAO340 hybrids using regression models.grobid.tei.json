The regression model refers to the prediction of the value of a dependent variable from the values of one or more independent variables. This study evaluated morphological traits of maize (FAO410) on six treatments of fertilizer in 2 years in Debrecen University by the regression model. This experiment was RCBD with four replications in the Látókép zone. Treatments were included in different levels of fertilizer: nitrogen, phosphor, and potassium. The regression model was significant at one percent that showed morphological traits have a straight effect on the yield of maize in FAO410 and FAO340. Grain yield had a positive correlation with plant height, outer ear diameter, the weight of ear, weight of cob, number of leaves, weight of all seeds in each ear, the weight of one thousand seeds on FAO410, and grain yield had a positive correlation with plant height, stem diameter, outer ear diameter, the weight of ear, weight of cob, number of seeds in each column, weight of all seeds in each ear, weight of the fresh plant in a hectare, the weight of one thousand seeds on FAO340 too. Cluster analysis showed the traits classification on two groups on hybrids. Reach maximum grain yield require the evaluation of yield components and their effect.",

Corn is high on grain and dry matter yield, having a varied nutritional value in the supply of carbohydrates, and edible oils in the agricultural economy of different countries are of particular importance (Nagy 2006). Maize (Zea Mays L.) as a staple food and forage crop has grown under a wide range of climates worldwide (Wang et al. 2008) and throughout much of the New World (Mexico, Central America, and South America) is an important plant. It is also the third-largest crop after wheat and rice in terms of area under cultivation and production (Kumar 2014).",

Access to quantities and types of fertilizer can absorb more elements from the soil and transfer it to the seed, which is essential to optimize fertilizer consumption and improve product quality (Anjum et al. 2007). Climatic factors and nutrients play an important role in accelerating this genetic potential (Eichelberger et al. 1989;Asghari and Hanson 1984).",

Inadequate nitrogen management is one of the important factors that reduce corn yield. Choosing the best method of nitrogen fertilizer is important for maximum yield and reduction of negative environmental impacts (Izadi and Emam 2010). Researchers have reported an increase in maize grain yield by increasing the amount of NPK chemical fertilizers due to the plant's greater access to nutrients; also, it has shown that mineralization of soil organic matter alone cannot fully meet plant nutrition needs (Karimi et al. 2011). Other researchers have reported increasing quantitative and qualitative characteristics of maize under the influence of NPK chemical fertilizers (Akbari et al. 2005;Kogbe and Adediran 2003;Mostafavi et al. 2013;Hejazi et al. 2013;Bramdeo et al. 2019;Mousavi et al. 2013Mousavi et al. , 2019a, b), b).",

Therefore, this experiment is conducted to estimate the effect of NPK chemical fertilizers on the quantitative and qualitative yield and trace element productivity in maize. Simple correlation, multiple regression and path analysis are used to analyze the components of yield and grain yield (Fraser 1983). Various methods exist for analyzing the yield components; the selection of the appropriate method is purely for research. One of these methods is the stepwise regression analysis. Identification of appropriate traits can be the basis of selection in breeding programs, and it can be useful to maximize grain yield (Pirzadeh Moghaddam et al. 2014).",

Also, effective traits on FAO340 hybrid include plant height, stem diameter, outer ear diameter, the weight of ear, the weight of cob, number of seeds in each column, weight of all seeds in each ear, the weight of the fresh plant in a hectare, the weight of one thousand seeds. Extensive studies have been conducted to determine the correlation and analysis of genetic parameters of grain yield through the components of yield. Grain yield is a complex trait controlled by various morphological and physiological traits (Crosbie and Mock 1981). Thus, genetic control of yield is indirectly influenced by traits that are correlated with yield and increasing yield and improving its genetic characteristics is a function of various morphological and physiological traits. Understanding the correlation between yield and its components and finding the type of relationship between them can increase grain yield (Kalla et al. 2001). Another study also reported that grain yield had a positive and significant correlation with plant height, ear height and number of ear rows per ear (Sadek et al. 2006). In correlation analysis, some traits do not have a significant relationship with yield, and in regression analysis, some variables do not have a significant effect on the function (Farshadfar 1998). The results of stepwise regression analysis of maize showed that weight of one thousand grain yield and cob weight with negative coefficients, and the depth of planting and plant height with positive coefficients, justified 52% of total changes in grain yield and have been identified as effective traits in increasing grain yield (Amiri et al. 2009). In another study, it was reported that grain yield had a positive and significant correlation with plant height, ear height and number of rows in the ear (Sadek et al. 2006). Cluster analysis showed that breeding seeds and plant or reach the highest yield must be which part of the plant is significant, or have the maximum effect of the other parts. Morphological traits of maize by cluster analysis showed that area of the flag leaf, grain rows, peduncle length out of flag leaf and ear conicalness index were important traits of 25 traits on this experience (Choukan et al. 2005).",

So to increase yield, attention needs to be paid to more traits. Therefore, it will be difficult to control multigenes or traits of work. This study tries to facilitate the study of yield by clustering traits and classification of the traits. Therefore, the effective traits of yield are classified into two groups. In correlation and regression analyses, the interaction effects of traits with each other as well as the slope of the regression line have identified the traits that had the greatest effect on grain yield. Through studying (reducing or increasing) traits, maximum grain yield can be achieved in two hybrids and different levels of fertilizer to gain optimal stability yield. Breeders can also use the result of the research to study the effects on yield as well as plant breeding. Overall, to test the viability of these hybrids, it will require 3 years of testing, which will be reported soon.",
