However, maize has been a leading and integral staple food for humans. Considering the importance of maize and its cultivation potential worldwide and in Iran, this crop's yield sustainability was studied in previous research. Genotype × environment interaction (GEI) is responsible for genotype sustainability characteristics . One of the usual exacting effects in plant breeding development is to dissect the genotype × environment (GE) interaction correctly. In most trails, the G × E interaction was witnessed and then modeled statistically and elucidated. Genotype × environment interaction adjusts the reasonable grain yield of genotypes in diverse environments and makes it hard to select the better ones . Multilocation and multiyear trials can help identify superior and sustainable genotypes . It can also help to identify different environments through the differences between genotypes with minimal replicates. Environments with better yield can distinguish superior genotypes in target environments . Identifying high-yielding and sustainable genotypes in diverse environments has been a constant challenge for plant breeders worldwide. Features of sustainable genotypes made possible by successive genotype × environment interactions (GEI). Since the environment very much influences genotypes, locations, and years, performance related to the stability of genotypes is a prerequisite and must carry out in different environments over different years in a given location . Plant breeders are evaluating genotypes in multienvironment trials (MET), including in favorable and unfavorable environmental conditions on the genotype × environment interaction (GEI). MET variance analysis provides reasonable estimates of the critical effects of genotype (G) and environment (E) and genotype × environment interaction (GEI) in which the effects of G and GEI mainly lead to cultivar evaluation. e value of observed genetic variance varies from one environment to another due to interaction effect, and it tends to improve in superior environments higher than unfavourable environments . e genotype-environment interaction (GEI) for quantitative traits such as grain yield can limit the selection of superior genotypes to develop modified cultivars . To calculate GEI, breeders evaluate genotypes in various environments to identify high-yielding and stable genotypes. Genotypes with no GEI are considered stable genotypes . Yield stability is one of the most desirable traits of a genotype that allows it to identify as a cultivar. e construction of a largescale facility is required to study genotypes, referring to as specific adaptability. To achieve maximum production, it is essential to develop hybrid varieties that best fit given target environments and have specific adaptability. Additive main effects and multiplicative interaction analysis (AMMI) allow for a large set of technical interpretations, and they were used more commonly to evaluate the genotype-environment interactions. e additive main effects and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) model addresses the limitations of ANOVA and PCA.",

AMMI stability value (ASV), the distance of the coordinates of each genotype from the origin of the biplot coordinate diagram of the two principal components of the interaction, is based on the scores of the first and second for interaction principal component axis (IPCA) model for each genotype .

Due to the significant combined analysis, the grain yield stability could be examined and hybrids with specific adaptability to each environment and hybrids with general adaptability to all environments can be measured. e significance of genotype × environment interaction indicated that environments could classify GEI [28,29]. e SC647 genotype with the lowest AMMI stability value (0.001) was identified as the most stable genotype among 12 genotypes. e highest ASV related to the SC302 genotype (0.072). e sum of the yield and stability rankings (YSI) ranked KSC707 as the genotype that combined high yield with stability. e KSC706 genotype though high yielding was unstable because of its low rank according to the YSI. e two genotypes KSC400 and DC370 can be considered high yielding and stable (Ranking of 12 hybrids of maize and 8 environments based on the AMMI stability value (ASV)). erefore, genotypes that have been considered stable genotypes based on ASV and IPCA parameters tend to have a lower average yield [30]. Using stability parameters on data obtained from four regions in the first crop year, KSC260, KSC705, SC647, and SC301 hybrids showed the highest value of the parameters. Also, KSC703, KSC707, and DC370 genotypes identified as the most unstable hybrids due to their high statistic levels. Based on the analysis of the four tested regions in the first crop year, the second crop year, and the mean of two crop years, and considering all the calculated parameters, SC647 and KSC705 genotypes identified as the most stable and KSC707 and KSC706 genotypes as the most unstable genotypes in case of grain yield. AMMI can have several models: AMMI0, which estimates the main additive effect of genotypes and environments and does not include any major axis (IPCA); AMMI1, which combines AMNI0 genotype additive effects with environmental interactions estimated and combines from the first major axis (IPCA 1); and AMMI2 and others up to the full model with all IPCA axes. [31]. According to the AMMI1 graph, which explained 73.4% of the total squares of the data variance, the environmental share was 38.36%, the genotype share was 12.01%, and the first component share was 23%. Accordingly, a genotype close to the mean axis and on the positive axis is more stable. KSC400, KSC705, and SC647 genotypes were more stable in comparison with other genotypes. KSC706, KSC703, and KSC707 genotypes are the most unstable, low-yielding genotypes, and the DC370 genotype, the most stable, highyielding genotype. Environmental stability is essential for demonstrating the reliability of genotype ordering in a given environment about the rating for the environments in question [32]. According to the AMMI2 graph, 68.1% of the data variance explained 46.4% of the first component and 21.7% to the second component. Considering this graph, SC604 and SC302 genotypes in E7 and E1 environments; DC370 genotype in E4 environment; KSC400, KSC707, and KSC706 genotypes in E5 environment; and KSC260 and SC301 genotypes in E3 environment benefited from a desirable yield. Regarding the AMMI2 graph, the SC647 genotype was more stable than other genotypes, but unlike the AMMI1 graph with more stable KSC705 and KSC400 genotypes, these genotypes identified as unstable (Figures 1 and2).
