This increase has to be achieved in a scenario of climate change particularly characterised by heat stress. Several agronomic and genetic strategies for increased tolerance to high temperatures will be necessary. Some results in other crops showed interactions between high temperature stress and nitrogen (N) availability. To the best of our knowledge, this interaction has not been tested in maize. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore, under field conditions, whether the magnitude of yield penalty imposed by elevated canopy air temperature around flowering or during early grain filling is affected by N availability. In particular we aimed to (i) quantify the magnitude of yield losses by heat stress around flowering and during early grain filling, (ii) determine whether N fertilisation affects these magnitudes, and (iii) identify whether the effects are indirect (through affecting growth) or directly on the grain set and/or grain growth capacity. Four field experiments were carried out during four consecutive years in NE Spain. The treatments consisted in a factorial combination of one or two hybrids, two or three levels of N fertilisation and three temperature conditions. The temperature treatments consisted of a control (plots grown under natural temperature throughout the growing season) and two treatments in which the temperatures of the canopy were increased in the field for relatively short periods. All experiments were well watered to avoid water stress.",

However, yield penalty imposed by heat stress was in general very noticeable and dramatic when the treatment included the critical period for grain number determination, around silking. The damage was much stronger in the long-than in the short-cycle hybrid. Exposing the plants to elevated canopy air temperature during the critical period reduced harvest index, from values of around 46% in unheated conditions to 20% under elevated canopy air temperature, being the reduction higher under N200 than under N0 fertilisation treatments.",

The effect of N on emphasising the penalties seemed not to be a direct effect of this nutrient but and indirect effect through affecting growth. The effect was through affecting the capacity of the plants to set grains and to a lesser extent to allow grain weight to be maximised; and it was independent of any (potentially additional) effects on either uncoupling anthesis and silking or on pollen amount and viability.",

          "text": "Yield of cereals must increase dramatically in the next few decades. This need is based on predictions of population increase to some 10 billion people and on the simultaneous growth of individual demands. Maize demand would also increase noticeably due to the expected increase in its use in biofuel production towards 2050 (Fischer et al., 2014). These remarkable increases must be achieved in the context of a climate change which will imply that crops will be more frequently exposed not only to relatively higher temperatures but also to periods of heat stress (Battisti and Naylor, 2009;Lobell et al., 2011;Cairns et al., 2013).",

          "text": "Yield in maize is the consequence of the interaction between the number of grains and their average weight. Grain number is mainly determined during the critical period of 30 d bracketing silking (Vega et al., 2001;Andrade et al., 2002;Westgate et al., 2004) when the number of grains per plant is determined in line with the rate of growth of the crop during that period (Vega et al., 2001), because it is during this period when the juvenile ear, where the female florets are developing, grow (Otegui and Bonhomme, 1998) and then the abortion process affects a proportion of the pollinated florets. Grain weight potential is largely determined during the same period (Gambín et al., 2006) and formally realised during the \"lag phase\" (Maddonni et al., 1998); but final grain weight is realised during the effective period of grain filling (Cirilo and Andrade, 1996;Borrás and Otegui, 2001).",

          "text": "High-temperature effects on yield may affect either of the two components, depending on the timing of occurrence of the heat (Rattalino Edreira and Otegui, 2013). In principle, if the penalty imposed by the increased temperature operates, at least partly, through reductions in crop growth, yield would be more affected when the heat occurs during the grain number determination period (around silking) as grain number determination is clearly source-limited (Gambín et al., 2006;Slafer and Savin, 2006) whilst grain weight seems more limited by the sink strengths (Gambín et al., 2008), at least if severe defoliations or very low levels of incoming radiation do not occur during the effective period of grain filling (Borrás et al., 2004). The consequently higher responsiveness of grain number than grain weight to changes in resource availability (Slafer et al., 2014) explains why grain number is more plastic and grain weight more heritable (Sadras, 2007;Sadras and Slafer, 2012) and consequently yield is more related to grain number than to grain weight in most grain crops (Slafer et al., 2006), including maize (Otegui, 1995;Borrás et al., 2004). If the effects were not mediated by reducing crop growth, the magnitude of the penalty would be similar whether the stress occurs around silking or during the effective period of grain filling. It seems likely to hypothesise that high-temperature effects may be indirect, mediated by reducing growth (e.g. Cicchino et al., 2010b), though direct effects not mediated by reductions in growth are possible (Rattalino Edreira and Otegui, 2013). High temperature induce shortening of developmental phases, reduced light interception, increased respiration, reduced photosynthesis, and cause pollen sterility (e.g. Wahid et al., 2007;Barnabás et al., 2008;Cairns et al., 2013). It has been demonstrated that female tissues have greater tolerance while pollen production and/or viability is strongly sensitive to high temperatures. However, the sensitivity of the female reproductive tissues has also recently been highlighted as a critical (Cicchino et al., 2010b;Rattalino Edreira et al., 2011), as the damage produced by high temperatures on reproductive output remained when fresh pollen was used to pollinate ears of plants exposed to high temperatures around silking (Cicchino et al., 2010b).",

          "text": "A major inconvenience of studies aimed to uncover hightemperature effects on crop productivity is that, due to the difficulties in imposing the treatments under field conditions, they are most frequently conducted under controlled conditions. These controlled studies are extremely useful for understanding detailed mechanisms of action of particular factors at relatively low levels of organisation. The problem is that results can hardly be extrapolated to field conditions (Passioura, 2006), where the practical consequences are expected. Scaling up from controlled conditions experiments to application in realistic field conditions may present several constraints (Passioura, 2010).",

Normally the approach of studying this type of stresses in the field is that the errors increase noticeably compared with controlled conditions, but the increase in reliability on the extrapolation of conclusions makes them indispensable. A step forward in direction to increase the actual value of the conclusions to realistic system is to run such experiment in real farmer fields (instead than in a field experimental facility) and in interaction with very common management practices, such as nitrogen (N) fertilisation, a step we pursued in this study. This again increases the errors while increasing the dependability of conclusions.",

The likelihood of mitigations through using plant growth regulators (Cicchino et al., 2013), or adequate management of magnesium (Mengutay et al., 2013) are being discussed. Around the world, food production increased linearly with the increment of N use in the agricultural systems (Tilman, 1999), and N fertilisation is likely one of the most common management practices implemented in maize production worldwide. High yields in maize are closely associated with N fertilisation (Setiyono et al., 2010), mainly through affecting grain number (Cárcova et al., 2000;Paponov et al., 2005) by modifying crop growth during the critical period around silking (Andrade et al., 2002;D'Andrea et al., 2008).",

Although the mechanisms involved are not understood, reporting evidences of this type of interaction would be relevant in practical terms. If a similar sort of interaction were also apparent in maize, it may have relevant practical implications as in the future, when maize would be more often exposed to heat stresses. In this scenario, decisions on rates of N fertilisation should be taken not only considering the potential beneficial effects on crop growth but also the potential trade off on the magnitude of the penalty produced by heat stresses.",

N content was determined using the Kjeldahl method to the milled samples of leaf, stems and grains. N uptake was estimated as plant N in biomass and grains at harvest. The three individual plants labelled in each experimental unit were non-destructively measured once or twice a week from 15 d before to 15 d after silking and biomass accumulation during the critical period for grain number determination was estimated based on allometric relationships (Vega et al., 2001). These relationships were derived from conventional plant samplings across different treatments and timings in all the experiments in which we measured morphometric variables (plant height, stem diameter at the base of the plant, length and diameter of the base of the ear; allowing the assessment of stem plus ear volumes, as in D' Andrea et al., 2008) as well as above-ground dry weight through oven-drying the samples for 72 h at 65 • C.

The dynamics of SPAD values through grain filling was determined by fitting linear or bi-linear regressions (the former in very few occasions in which senescence had started at silking).

This is well illustrated by the fact that yield was linearly related to biomass but with an intercept significantly negative (Fig. 5a), implying that harvest index was reduced in line with reductions in biomass. Therefore, exposing the plants to elevated canopy air temperatures during the critical period dramatically reduced harvest index, from values of around 42% for N0 and 50% for N200 in unheated conditions to 19% under N200 and 21% under N0 (inset Fig. 5a); and consequently again the magnitude of the reduction was higher in N200 (62%) than in N0 (50%).",

The intercept of the relationship was significantly negative (Fig. 7a), implying that the intercept on the abscissa, [-a b -1 ], was significantly positive. This intercept on the abscissa reflects the minimum plant growth rate during the critical period for allowing grain set to occur was 1.46 g d -1 when limiting the regression analysis to the long-cycle hybrids (Fig. 7a; and it was 1.32 g d -1 if including the short-cycle hybrid data). Therefore, the linear relationship reflects a consistent decrease in the efficiency of conversion of growth during this period into grains actually set with the heat stress as well, and the reduction in this sort of \"fruiting efficiency\" (the number of grains set per unit of plant growth rate during the critical period) was larger under high-than under low-N availability levels (inset of Fig. 7a). The reduction in fruiting efficiency caused by elevated canopy air temperature stress starting before silking was even larger than the already noticeable reduction in plant growth rate during the critical period (Fig. 7a). It was due to Relationships between the number of grains per plant and plant growth rate during the critical period (CP) of grain number determination, reflecting differences in the efficiency of conversion of growth during that period into grains set (a), and between the ear dry weight at silking and total aboveground biomass at that stage determining differences in the efficiency of partitioning of biomass to the ear (b).

Thus there was another indirect effect through reducing significantly ear growth before silking through diminishing partitioning of biomass to the ear at silking (Fig. 7b), consequently reducing ear growth during the critical period even more than the reduction in plant growth. Second through a direct effect evidenced by the fact that the number of grains set per unit ear dry weight at silking was also dramatically reduced by the heat stress, and tended to be affected more at high than at low N availability: averaging across experiments the elevated canopy air temperature in pre-silking reduced the number of grains set per unit ear dry weight at silking under N0 by 14.2 grains g ear -1 (from 25.2 ± 3.2 to 11.0 ± 4.5 grains g ear -1 ), while under N200 it was reduced by 18.0 grains g ear -1 (from 29.9 ± 4.5 to 11.9 ± 5.0 grains g ear -1 ).

In this plot, we fitted the data through a bilinear relationship that assumes that under low source-sink ratios grain weight would be limited by the source strength (and therefore a positive relationship would be expected), whilst at large source-sink ratios grain weight would be largely independent of the source strength and controlled by the capacity of the grains to grow (and then there would be no relationship between grain weight and the source-sink ratio) (Fig. 8b).",

Data-points on the right of the 1:1 ratio are cases in which grain weight would have hardly been source-limited, and within that part of the cloud of data it was clearly consistent that grains exposed to elevated canopy air temperature during the period of grain filling did reach a final weight lower than those under unheated conditions, even though they had much larger source-sink ratios (derived from the reduction of grain number produced by the heat stress imposed 15 d after silking) (Fig. 8b). Data-points on the left of the 1:1 line did show a clear positive relationship between final grain weight and plant growth per grain during post-silking, (Fig. 8b), and were a major contributor to the positive part of the bi-linear relationship fitted to the whole dataset. Within this subset (of data-points to the left of the 1:1 ratio) the plants subjected to high temperature from 15 d after silking had lower values of both variables than the unheated plants, which could be interpreted as a reflection of an indirect effect of temperature on grain growth, through accelerating senescence and source-limiting grain growth more than under unheated conditions. However, there are two reasons for not accepting straightforwardly that high temperature stress reduced grain weight in this subset through limiting source per grain. First, all these presumably source-limited cases are actually very close to the 1:1 ratio (where it is presumed a sink limitation for grain growth) and chances are that remobilisation of water soluble carbohydrates reserved in vegetative organs before silking would have a potential contribution to grain growth but not to plant growth after silking (as they were part of the pre-silking growth) and therefore the line separating source-and sink-limited grain weight should be biased towards the left by a magnitude equivalent to the amount of water soluble reserves accumulated at silking (a variable that unfortunately we did not measure). Second, and supporting the first argument, the actual grain weight of these presumably source-limited cases exhibited the same range of grain weights of the data-points on the right of the 1:1 line (Fig. 8b). Analysing the relationship across the whole range of post-silking biomass accumulation per grain set it is again clear that throughout it (even for the cases on the left of the 1:1 ratio) the residuals of the heated plants were negative (-22.1 mg grain -1 ) and those of the unheated plants were positive (+5.6 mg grain -1 ). All in all it seemed most likely that the effects of heat stress during the effective grain filling period directly on the capacity of the grains to grow would have been more relevant than the indirect effects through reducing the source-sink ratio during grain filling (if any).",

This provides further support to the overall view that grain size reduction imposed by heat stress during grain filling was a direct effect on sink strength rather than an indirect effect mediated through a reduction in source strength.",

Thus, high temperature stress imposed during the critical period resulted in higher grain protein concentrations than when applied during the effective period of grain filling (Fig. 10a). Overall the data-points felt around the 1:1 ratio between relative changes in yield and protein concentration, as revealed by the fact that the fitted regression had an intercept not significantly different from zero and a slope not significantly different from 1 (Fig. 10a). N fertilisation also favoured grain protein but only when the dose was large, as in N100 the extra growth and yield produced by the fertilisation did not alleviate the source limitation for grain N accumulation compared to the unfertilised controls (Fig. 10a).",

Thus, the higher the N utilisation efficiency (the yield level per unit of N uptaken by the plants) the lower the grain protein concentration (Fig. 10b).

As this effect is more notorious with direct radiation, overall the day and across sunny and cloudy days, the reduction in incident radiation would have been considerable less. Thus, even though the magnitude of the reduction in PAR at the top of the canopy would have been minor, it cannot be discarded that at least a small part of the effects reported might be due to the reduced radiation. On the contrary, the polyethylene film would have also increased the proportion of diffuse radiation (Cabrera et al., 2009;Soar et al., 2009), and diffuse radiation increases RUE (Sinclair et al., 1992;Soar et al., 2009;Rattalino Edreira and Otegui, 2012).

We found, and as far as we are aware for the first time in maize grown in field conditions, that the losses in yield in response to elevated canopy air temperature were magnified by the availability of N. In other words, that while fertilising with N is rather relevant to maximise yield in most realistic field conditions, it may be also necessary to have into account that well fertilised maize crops may be more sensitive to heat stresses. This may require, more and more often (as the events of heat stress tend to increase with global change), that the doses of N fertilisation be fine-tuned to avoid yield penalties derived from N stress but at the same time to avoid higher yield penalties in the event of heat stress.

Therefore, the strength of the conclusions of the present study are no limited to the number of field experiments in which they are based but also in that the limited amount of evidences of this sort of interaction available in the literature for other cereals are all in line with them. Two further elements of strength in our study are the experimental approach and the magnitude of the treatments. Regarding the approach, all our results come from field experiments, when the vast majority of knowledge on the effects of high temperature is based from extrapolations from more or less controlled conditions. As extrapolation of conclusions from controlled conditions may be difficult to accept straightforwardly (Passioura, 2006), counting with results from field experiments is essential before conclusions could be extrapolated. We are only aware of very few other cases in which high temperature treatments were imposed to maize crops in the field (in all cases from the lab of Prof. Otegui;e.g. Rattalino Edreira et al., 2011 andCicchino et al., 2010a,b), with an approach similar to that we used in the present study, and that has been used in the past for small-grained cereals (which are far easier to manage due to the size of the plots; e.g. Borghi et al., 1995;Rawson, 1995;Savin et al., 1996;Calderini et al., 1999;Passarella et al., 2002). Regarding the magnitude of treatments, the extrapolation of results can many times be difficult when treatments are too extreme (which is always attractive to researchers as it facilitates detection of effects). N fertilisation treatments were well within normal rates used by farmers in the region (e.g. Berenguer et al., 2009) and temperature increases were not only reasonable in magnitude but also in the way they were imposed: a heating system based on the greenhouse effect allowing a steady increase during de morning and early afternoon followed by a gradual decrease every afternoon-evening to maximum values averaging relatively likely temperatures in realistic hot days of most temperate regions worldwide (daily maximum temperatures, averaging across the canopy, normally below 40 • C). This is critically important as the effect of heat not only depends on the magnitude of the high temperature used but also on the rate of change in temperatures for imposing the stress (Wahid et al., 2007). The relevance of the rate of increase from minimum to maximum temperatures to have trustworthy conclusions was already evidenced both in small grained cereals (Savin et al., 1997) and in maize (Crafts-Brandner and Salvucci, 2002). Suddenly imposed treatments, unlike what happens in days with stressful maximum temperatures, do not allow for acclimation processes to take place and therefore might overestimate the magnitude of the penalties actually expected in reality.",

This means that the large reduction in grain number did not bring about any consistent feed-forward effect: the relatively few grains remaining after the removal of the heat stress did grow normally (average grain weight was similar to that of the unheated plants, and grain protein increased markedly in response to the dramatic increase in source-sink ratio generated by the collapse in grain number). It is worth noting that in our study the relationship between grain number and plant growth rate during the critical period was strongly linear when it is frequently curvilinear (hyperbolic) in the literature (e.g. Vega et al., 2001;Cicchino et al., 2010b). In our opinion, this conflict is only apparent and is based on the fact that in studies showing clearly the hyperbolic relationship, plant growth rate during the critical period was enhanced well beyond what may be found in most realistic agronomic conditions, mainly through exploring extremely low plant densities (which is well justified with the aim to analyse a relationship covering the whole possible range in both variables being analysed). As in our study we did not impose treatments maximising individual plant growth (like growing the crop at very low density of c. 2 plants m -2 ) but did explore very low plant growth due to the imposition of abiotic stresses; we may well have explored the first part of the most likely hyperbolic relationship, which naturally has a very strong linear component. In fact, in some cases reporting hyperbolic relationships, if the range of variation for plant growth rate during the critical period is restricted to 1-3 g plant -1 d -1 (the range explored in our study) the relationship would have been strongly linear as well (e.g. Figs. 1 and 3 corresponding to maize in Vega et al., 2001). Thus, we do not propose an alternative model to understand the relationship between grain number and plant growth rate during the critical period; in fact we believe the curvilinear model is unquestionably correct but our study did not explore the range of conditions making plants to grow in absence of competition and consequently only explored the first part of the well-known curvilinear relationship in maize, which is strongly linear.",

The fact that the results of other independent studies not having N fertilisation as a treatment fit well the same relationship with data of the present study (Fig. 11a) provides further support to the conclusion that the effect of N on affecting the magnitude of the loss was indirect through plant growth, which is in agreement with previous results both in maize (Andrade et al., 2002), and in other cereals (Demotes-Mainard and Jeuffroy, 2004;Prystupa et al., 2004;Ferrante et al., 2010), although exceptions for some genotypes may be found (e.g. D' Andrea et al., 2008).",

It is likely that this lack of effect is revealing that the temperature on the heat-stressed plots would have been above the optimum temperature for at least a significant part of the day. Estimates of relatively low optimum temperatures for the critical period ranging from 30 to 36 • C were recently reported by Cicchino et al. (2010a) and are in line with optimum temperatures estimated for leaf appearance rates in maize (Kim et al., 2007). Optimum temperatures within the range that plants can be exposed to in realistic field conditions had also been reported for wheat (Slafer and Rawson, 1995). Heat stress does affect the availability and viability of pollen (Schoper  et al., 1986, 1987;Mitchell and Petolino, 1988) as pollen desiccation is a function of air temperature and pollen viability decreased linearly with pollen humidity (Aylor, 2003;Fonseca and Westgate, 2005). However, in the present experiments none of the highly expected effects of heat on pollen availability and viability were part of the causes of reduction in grain number when plants were heat-stressed during the critical period as the silks in each of the pants were pollinated with fresh pollen. The fact that yield penalties produced by heat stress were not mitigated by pollinating heated plants with fresh pollen had been already reported (Cicchino et al., 2010b); indicating that the major avenue by which heat affected yield dramatically was indirectly through affecting growth of the ears and/or directly through affecting grain abortion. N fertilisation did not consistently affect phenology either. D'Andrea et al. ( 2009) compared developmental attributes of inbred lines and hybrids to extremely contrasting N fertilisation regimes (0 and 400 kg N ha -1 ) finding no differences in final leaf number and only relatively marginal advances in silking (averaging 20 and 40 • C d for lines and hybrids, respectively), with significant genotype × N interactions. This is more or less in line with a lack of consistent evidences from field experiments in other cereals (Hall et al., 2014).",

Important reductions in radiation use efficiency would be expected as high temperatures would concurrently reduce photosynthesis and increase respiration (Tollenaar, 1989;Crafts-Brandner and Salvucci, 2002;Sinsawat et al., 2004;Kim et al., 2007). This effect on plant growth was complemented with a reduction in partitioning of that growth to the growing juvenile ear. Although the effect might be reversed after the stress is removed (e.g. Cicchino et al., 2010b) abiotic stresses during the critical period of grain number determination do normally reduce dry matter partitioning to the ears (Andrade et al., 2002;Echarte and Tollenaar, 2006;D'Andrea et al., 2008).",

No clear mechanisms can be proposed at this stage for these direct effects inducing abortion of pollinated female florets, but the fact that abiotic stresses may induce fertile florets to be abortive, even if grain set is warranted by manipulating pollination, has been already reported (Bassetti and Westgate, 1993;Otegui et al., 1995;Cárcova and Otegui, 2001) and possible mechanisms suggested (Barnabás et al., 2008). In the study by Rattalino Edreira and Otegui, (2012), the main damage produced by heat stress during the critical period was also associated with direct more than with indirect effects. These direct effects are largely responsible for the important reduction in harvest index caused by heat stress during the critical period (as the collapse in yield was related to a relatively modest reduction in total growth and N uptake). This effect of heat stress on harvest index is rather common (Craufurd et al., 2002;Cicchino et al., 2010b;Rattalino Edreira and Otegui, 2012).",

          "text": "Due to the large direct effects of heat stress during the critical period on grain number through reducing considerably fruiting efficiency, it was expected a likely increase in average grain size due to two physiological mechanisms. First, chances are that abortion of organs follows a hierarchy and therefore grains of smaller size potential would abort more than those of higher grain potential size (Acreche and Slafer, 2006). Second, reductions in fruiting efficiency might be expectedly related to increases in potential size of the grains, as ovaries of the florets might grow more if more assimilates were available per floret reaching the stage of fertile floret (Gambín et al., 2006;Ferrante et al., 2012). In fact, (i) large differences in grain size among crops seems to be based on the ratio between crop growth during the critical period for grain number determination and the number of grains set with those resources (Gambín and Borrás, 2010;Marti and Slafer, 2014); and (ii) if fruiting efficiency is increased by synchronising pollination it promotes parallel decrease in grain weight (Uribelarrea et al., 2008). However, we did not find any consistent increase in grain weight compensating, at least partially, the large reduction in grain number produced by the heat during the critical period. A recent paper also showed evidences supporting that heat stress during the critical period of grain number determination, even when reducing considerably fruiting efficiency, does only marginally affect grain size (Rattalino Edreira et al., 2014). It might be possible then to speculate that there would be a direct effect of temperature on potential size of the grains which is not detectable in the present (and the other above-mentioned) study because it would have been counterweighed by of the potential increase produced by the large improvement in plant growth per grain set.",

Thus the grains set in the plants subjected to heat stress during the grain determination period were not impaired in their capacity to accumulate N, which is normally strongly limited by the source. That is why the effects of the combinations of elevated canopy air temperature × N fertilisation treatments on N utilisation efficiency were very strongly negatively related to grain protein concentration. Similar results were shown for wheat (Pedro et al., 2011;Ferrante et al., 2012) in the absence of heat stress.",

This means that it is likely that, at least for the hybrids and background conditions used in the present study and in that carried out by Rattalino Edreira and Otegui, (2012), which were quite different, the critical period for grain number determination seemed to have actually finished at least a bit later than 15 d after silking. Then, it is likely that the critical period of grain number determination may have lasted for a bit longer than what is usually acknowledged in the literature. In part it may be difficult to have a universal and incontrovertible duration of this critical period as hybrids may differ in the duration of the lag phase (Maddonni et al., 1998), which is the phase when simultaneously the potential size of the grains is being formed and the final rate of abortion is being determined (i.e. grain number is finally established during the early grain-filling period; Gambín et al., 2008).",

The analysis of the effects on the postsilking growth per grain set reinforces the idea that the effects were direct on the capacity of the grains to grow: due to the reduction imposed in grain number, biomass accumulation per grain during post-silking was higher in the heat-stressed than in the unheated plants. Furthermore, the heat stress was mild enough not to allow a clear and consistent acceleration of chlorophyll loss from the leaves. The conclusion that the effect was mainly direct on the capacity of the grains to grow is commensurate with the idea that the effective grain filling is largely sink-limited (Borrás et al., 2004;Gambín et al., 2006, 2008). Rattalino Edreira et al. (2014) have recently concluded that in their study that grain weight reductions due to heat imposed during the early part of the effective grain filling period was not directly related to reductions in assimilate availability per grain but to a direct effect, providing further support to the conclusion from the present study.",

For instance, at high temperature grains could hardly grow even when the concentration of soluble sugars was high (Jones et al., 1981). Thus high temperature effect on grain size cannot be reversed, nor diminished, by increasing the source-sink ratio (Slafer and Miralles, 1992). Another direct effect of heat stress on grain weight might be through increasing the rate of water loss from the grain during the first half of the effective grain filling period (Rattalino Edreira et al., 2014). The dynamics of water content is quite relevant in establishing the final weight of the grains (Borrás et al., 2003;Gambín et al., 2007;Borrás and Gambín, 2010) and treatments affecting this dynamics might impair normal grain growth beyond any effects on availability of soluble sugars to synthesise starch.",
