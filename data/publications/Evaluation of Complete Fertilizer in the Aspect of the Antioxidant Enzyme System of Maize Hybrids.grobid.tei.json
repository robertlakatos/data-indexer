Two different maturity groups of maize hybrids were tested in this study. The research site was located at the Látókép Experimental Station of the University of Debrecen and the experiment lasted for 2 years. The examined nitrogen ranges were separated into two parts. Firstly, the effects of nitrogen fertilizer ranging from 120-300 kg ha -1 were examined, supplemented with a constant, high-level P 2 O 5 and K 2 O. Secondly, the optimal ratio of N:P:K was measured. In order to monitor the health status of maize hybrids, stress indicators including the activity of ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and superoxide dismutase (SOD), the rate of lipid peroxidation (LP), and grain yield were measured. The samples were taken in five phenological stages. Variance analysis based on nitrogen fertilizer showed variation in sampling times and fertilizers on APX, LP, and SOD. Variance analysis based on NPK indicated variation in sampling times, years, and fertilizer levels on APX, LP, and SOD. Correlation analysis showed that yield correlated negatively with SOD during the use of NPK fertilizer, as the use of nitrogen fertilizer cannot make corrections to yield with SOD but phosphorus and potassium can correlate with yield, and SOD. Principal component analysis showed that NPK5 and N5 had maximum stability and effect on yield. The activity of APX had the highest value during silking, and LP was in the V14 leaf stage. The correlation and principal component analysis showed that silking and the V14 leaf stage are the most important stages for yield, thus, higher attention must be paid to these stages in the LP and the activation of APX to achieve maximum yield.",

          "text": "The adaptability of modern maize hybrids to abiotic stress factors is variable. The responses of maize to different abiotic stressors can be measured and evaluated based on the activity level of antioxidant enzymes. Effects of weather extremities, nutrition, and other abiotic stressors during crop production can be properly monitored by examining plant physiological parameters. Successful crop production requires detailed knowledge of the abiotic stress responses of new maize hybrids . Optimizing water and fertilizer consumption causes reduced production costs, while saving resources, and reducing environmental pollution. Nitrogen (N) is a particularly important nutrient for crops, especially maize . It is crucial to determine the optimal amount of applied nitrogen to manage highly effective and environment-friendly maize production, therefore, excessive N-fertilization can be prevented. In addition, maize needs different nutrients at different stages of its growth; during the growth of maize, nutrients are very important .",

Temperature in June was well above average, followed an average July and a clearly above average August, with the positive anomaly continuing into the autumn. Monthly precipitation was average in April and well above average in May, followed by June and July with a clear precipitation deficit. The average monthly rainfall for August ended the autumn months with a deficit. Compared to the five years, the growing season of 2019 showed probably the most unfavourable picture, with very low precipitation and high maximum temperatures. In June in particular, the strong positive temperature anomaly was coupled with exceptionally high irradiance values. In terms of heat sum, the second highest value in five years was obtained with 1723.7 • C degree days (Figure 1). Rainfall in the spring was followed by especially high monthly totals in the three summer months. There was a slightly positive precipitation anomaly in autumn. In terms of air temperature conditions, the most striking feature was the significant negative temperature anomaly in May, which, coupled with the lack of precipitation in the spring, negatively affected development during the sowing and emergence period. For the summer months, June and July brought average or slightly cooler than average weather, while August was a warmer than average summer period, a trend that continued into the autumn months. However, it can be noted that the persistent heat waves that were frequent in the past were absent in 2020. The abundant rainfall around the silking period and moderately high temperatures at this critical stage of development probably helped to produce a high yield. The approximately 1500 °C degree days was the lowest value in five years (Figure 2).

The basis of these methods was the separation of variance or dispersion of data into several components . Tukey  proposed a multiple comparison method based on student domain statistics. In his method of q α (α,f) for all mean pairs, comparisons are used to determine the critical value. Therefore, the Tukey test declares that the two means have a significant difference if the absolute value of the difference between their samples is more than T α = q α (α,f) S y-i . The most widely used statistical index of bivariate correlation is the Pearson torque correlation coefficient, commonly called the Pearson correlation. Abbreviated as (r), the Pearson coefficient shows the degree to which there is a linear relationship between quantitative variables. A problem with a large number of variables is known as a multidimensional difficulty . Principal component analysis (PCA) is a multivariate technique whose main purpose is to reduce the dimension (number of variables) of a multivariate data set as much as possible to explain the changes of the primary variables in the data. This goal is achieved by converting the initial variables into a new set of uncorrelated variables called principal components, linear combinations of the main (primary) variables. They are arranged in such a way that the few first principal components calculate the maximum variability in the principal variables. Distribution biplots are suitable for analyzing the relationships between two variables, but their weakness in more complex relationships is due to many variables. However, PCA tries to figure out the relationships between the variables in other ways .",

          "text": "Variance analysis based on nitrogen fertilizer showed variation in sampling times and fertilizer levels on APX, LP, and SOD. Also, hybrids showed variations in grain yield. Years in fertilizer levels interaction had a variation on the activity of APX, LP, and grain yield. Years in hybrids in fertilizer levels' interaction had a variation on yield and APX. In addition, variance analysis based on NPK indicated variation in sampling times, years, and fertilizer levels on ascorbate APX, LP, and SOD. Also, hybrids showed variations in grain yield and the activity of SOD. Years in fertilizer interaction had a variation on the activity of APX, the rate of LP, SOD, and grain yield. Years in hybrids in fertilizer levels interaction showed a variation on APX, and grain yield. For this reason, NPK fertilization can change variation on hybrids. The use of phosphorus and potassium fertilizer can change density on SOD on hybrids, but if only nitrogen is applied, it cannot affect SOD density on hybrids. Complete fertilizer (NPK fertilizer) can cause stability and balance in maize hybrids on SOD, APX, and LP. As a result of nutrient replenishment, different maize hybrids respond differently to abiotic stress, due to which nutrient replenishment can eliminate the quantitative and qualitative decrease in yield caused by extreme abiotic effects. The study of the activity of enzymes acts as a marker process at different phenological stages, as a result of which we can immediately obtain information about the current physiological condition of our plant population during the growing season. The different macronutrients are determinants in enzymatic responses. The examination focused on the optimal nutrient supply and the effect of constant high phosphorus and potassium, with different levels of nitrogen. ROS appear as a result of oxidative stresses, classified as a common defense response against abiotic stresses . Correlation analysis showed that grain yield correlated with SOD during the use of the NPK fertilizer. Nitrogen fertilization cannot make corrections to yield with SOD, but phosphorus and potassium can correlate with yield and SOD. APX and LP correlated with yield due to nitrogen fertilization. In addition, nitrogen can make contact with APX, and the rate of LP in yield. However, under the same conditions, the phosphorus application fertilizer in bio fertilizer levels had the greatest effect on increasing the activity of polyphenol oxidase and superoxide enzymes . Increasing the nitrogen and phosphorus availability in the soil, both as chemical fertilizer and as a bio fertilizer, positively affects antioxidant enzymes, proline, soluble protein proteins, and malondialdhyde (MDA). Therefore, one of the metabolic responses of plants under environmental stress is the increase in the synthesis of soluble proteins, the accumulation of amino acids such as proline, which in the plant can lead to cell stability and maintenance of cell turpentine through osmotic regulation . Based on the experimental results of Mao et al. , by providing optimal nutrient replenishment in the appropriate phenophase and observing the physiological processes of maize, a significant increase in the activity of SOD, CAT, POD, APX, and GR was measured in maize leaves, which increased the concentration of lipid peroxidation and its oxidation . There was a strong correlation between early aging and N replenishment. The results obtained showed that the optimal amount of nitrogen was an effective method to prevent premature aging and provide stable maize yield . Principal component analysis showed that NPK5 and N 5 had maximum stability and effect on yield. The activity of APX was the highest value in silking stage, and LP was in the V14 leaf stage. The correlation and principal component analysis showed that silking stage and the 14th leaf stage are the important stages for yield in maize and one must concentrate on these stages in the LP and APX to achieve maximum yield. On the other hand, the activity of SOD was the maximum value in the 14th leaf stage. In this case, control SOD in the 14th leaf stage can contribute to maximum yield performance. Zhang et al.  (using soil containing 0 (N0), 30 (N1), and 50 (N2) Kg/ha nitrogen) proposed that the higher N-dose (N2) increased the antioxidant enzymatic activity, which resulted in a decrease in the rate of lipid peroxidation concentration in maize. The activity of protective enzymes (peroxidase and superoxide dismutase enzymes) and the soluble protein content in the plant were significantly decreased in the control treatment, which led to significant leaf aging. At an N level of 247.5 kg ha -1 , superoxide dismutase and peroxidase levels increased and MDA levels decreased, delaying the process of leaf aging in a later stage of development .",

Complete fertilizer (NPK fertilizer) resulted in stability and balance in the activity of SOD, APX, and LP in maize. Correlation showed that increasing the activity of SOD caused decreasing yield of the maize hybrid. The 14th leaf stage is highly important to the rate of LP, the activity of APX, and SOD to achieve maximum maize grain yield production. Increasing the activity of antioxidant enzymes in conditions of low water stress can also effectively reduce the adverse effects of stress.",
