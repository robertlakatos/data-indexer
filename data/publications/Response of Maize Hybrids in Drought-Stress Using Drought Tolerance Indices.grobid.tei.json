          "text": "This study was conducted to investigate the response of maize hybrids to drought stress and to select the most drought-tolerant cultivar compared to other hybrids. The experiment was performed on six maize hybrids in a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with three replications under regular irrigation and limited irrigation in the vegetative and reproductive stages in Iran. Drought tolerance indices (TOL, MP, GMP, STI, SSI, and HAR) for the grain yield of genotypes were calculated, and principal component analysis was based on them. The results obtained from estimating the indices showed that the SC647 and KSC704 hybrids, while having good performance in both conditions, also have drought tolerance. Examining the correlation between drought tolerance indices and yield in both conditions, among the indices used to detect drought tolerance, STI, MP, and GMP indices can be considered suitable for selecting high-yielding hybrids in these conditions. The principal components analysis on the stress-tolerance index showed that MP and GMP indices could be used as the best indices with high coefficients to select stress-tolerance hybrids. SC647 and KSC704 hybrids were identified and selected as hybrids with high tolerance to moisture stress. The results of drought tolerance indices in the emergence stage of the crest showed that the KSC260 hybrid has the lowest level of stress sensitivity. SC647 hybrids showed the lowest susceptibility to drought stress in the ear emergence stage.",

          "text": "Maize (Zea mays L.) is one of the essential cereals globally, and the third-most commonly grown crop after wheat and rice. In terms of yield, it has the highest amount of production among cereals . This plant provides 15-20% of the calories needed by people in more than 20 developing countries . According to the FAO, in 2014, the area under maize cultivation was 22.2 × 10 8 hectares, and the yield was 1.25 × 10 9 tons, worldwide. Forecasts show that demand for maize will double by 2050 . Limitations on the production of this plant can be called living and non-living stresses, but drought stress is considered the main limitation for maize production, worldwide . The increasing severity and duration of drought due to climate change is reducing the water available for absorption by plants, and the yield of maize is significantly affected by this phenomenon . Therefore, some research has been conducted to improve the yield of maize in drought conditions. One of the essential breeding goals to maintain maize production is producing greater yields with less water consumption . Due to drought pressure, decreased maize grain yield varies between 1 and 76%, depending on the plant's intensity, timing, and growth-stage . The results of many studies have shown that some plant growth periods are more sensitive to water stress. For example, water stress during inoculation of maize results in the injection of a small number of ovum, or none of them is inoculated, resulting in seedless maize ears . In a report, Fernandez  stated that the best measure for selecting genotypes under water-stress conditions is to select genotypes with optimal performance in both stress and non-stress conditions from other groups. Several selection criteria have been proposed to select genotypes based on their performance in stress and non-stress conditions . Measuring drought tolerance indices is necessary for evaluating drought-tolerant hybrids . Various indicators, including the stress tolerance index (TOL), the mean productivity index (MP), and the stress sensitivity index (SSI), have been proposed to evaluate the tolerance of genotypes to drought stress.",

          "text": "Drought tolerance is a complex trait controlled by many genes; progression to maize breeding for drought tolerance is very slow. Therefore, breeders use selection indices to select superior genotypes under drought stress conditions to breed maize . The simplest way to determine the relationship between two variables is to calculate the correlation coefficient, which shows the average relationship between the two variables. The significance of the correlation between the two variables indicates that both are influenced by common factors . Simple correlation coefficients have been widely used to know the linear relationship between performance and components or the percentage of pair relationships of performance components . Based on Ranjbar and Rousta study on wheat genotypes, the STI index was introduced as an effective indicator in genotype selection .",

          "text": "Fernandez  introduced the STI index as a valuable tool for determining the stresstolerance potential among genotypes. When the yield production (YP) is very different from the performance under stress conditions (YS), the mean productivity index (MP) will not be independent of the performance under normal conditions and will be skewed towards it. However, the Geometric Means Productivity Index (GMP) will not be skewed. Fernandez proposed the stress tolerance index (STI) based on the geometric mean productivity index, identifying tolerant genotypes in stress and non-stress conditions. Modifiers use the Geometric Means Productivity Index (GMP) to increase relative performance because drought stress can vary over the years in different conditions. Another study stated that the stress tolerance index (STI) is close to yield in normal irrigation and drought stress conditions. In other words, the plant is drought tolerant . Fernandez  divided the genotypes into four groups based on yield under stress and non-stress conditions: (A) high yield in both conditions), group (B) good yield only under stress conditions), group (C) good yield only under stress conditions) and group (D) poor performance in both conditions). This study evaluated the selection criteria for identifying water stress-tolerant hybrids in some maize hybrids. Suitable hybrids are recommended for cultivation in drought-prone areas of Iran and similar areas.",

          "text": "Indicators have advantages and disadvantages. The closer Ys (yield under stress conditions) is to Yp, the lower the sensitivity of the cultivar to water stress and, consequently, the smaller the SSI. The tolerance or susceptibility of hybrids determines drought-stress by comparing their SSI values [23]. To evaluate drought-tolerance, some maize hybrids were estimated according to the quantitative indicators of drought-tolerance, including mean productivity (MP), geometric mean productivity (GMP), harmonic mean (HAR), Stress Tolerance Index (STI), Stress Sensitivity Index (SSI), and Tolerance Index (TOL) for mean stress levels (Drought tolerance index values for maize hybrids under moderate water-stress conditions). The weakness of this index is its inability to recognizing group A from group C (genotypes that have higher relative yields only in stressful conditions). According to (Drought tolerance index values for maize hybrids under moderate water-stress conditions), KSC260 and SC647 were the hybrids with the lowest SSI and had the lowest stress sensitivity. Also, the KSC707 and SC640 genotypes were identified as sensitive genotypes due to higher SSI than stress. The high value of the TOL index indicates the high sensitivity of the cultivar to stress, and its low value is favorable for breeders. Based on this index, KSC260 and SC647 showed the lowest sensitivity to drought stress. The highest susceptibility was related to the KSC704 genotype. The selection of hybrids based on TOL and SSI is more desirable in areas with a high yield in stress conditions and a low or medium yield in non-stress conditions. Another studied index is the average productivity index, which is obtained from the mean productivity of yield under favorable conditions and stress [24]. A large amount of MP is a good criterion for selecting hybrids tolerant to drought stress. According to Drought tolerance index values for maize hybrids under moderate water-stress conditions, SC640, KSC704, and SC647 hybrids had the highest index values and were the most tolerant hybrids. Also, the KSC707 was selected as the most sensitive hybrid based on these factors. The GMP, or geometric mean productivity, will be less skewed due to its lower sensitivity to differences between Yp and Ys. In terms of this index, SC647, SC640, and KSC704 hybrids were the most tolerant. The STI, or stress tolerance index, includes yield potential in non-stress conditions, yield in stress conditions, and intensity. According to this index, the SC647, SC640, and KSC704 hybrids were the most tolerant to drought stress, and the KSC707 hybrid was the least tolerant. The KSC707 genotype was more sensitive than other cultivars in terms of this index. According to the study of tolerance indices, SC647 and SC640 can be identified as tolerant genotypes, and KSC707 as a susceptible genotype. The results are based on the harmonic average productivity index (HAR), indicating high-stress-tolerance and high-performance potential [25]. The highest values of water-stress-tolerance were related to SC647 and SC640 hybrids.",

The TOL (tolerance index) had a positive and significant correlation with the SSI (r = 0.91 **). The MP tolerance index had a positive and significant correlation (r = 0.83) in conditions without Yp stress in the ear emergence stage with grain yield, and MP (r = 0.82), GMP (r = 0.89), STI (* R = 0.90), and HAR (r = 0.94 **) had a positive and significant correlation in the ear-stress stage under Ys stress conditions with grain yield (Correlation between tolerance index and performance under stress conditions in the flowering stage).

A positive and significant correlation was observed for TOL with SSI (r = 0.93 **). Since MP-based selection increases average yield in stress and non-stress conditions, this index is not suitable for detecting group D genotypes (genotypes that do not perform well in stress and non-stress conditions). GMP is more suitable for isolating group D genotypes from other groups due to its lower sensitivity to differences between Yp and Ys. Among the studied indicators of STI, which is estimated based on GMP, it is of primary importance to selecting genotypes with high yields and greater tolerance to stress. The HAR has a significant correlation with Yp and Ys and can be a suitable index for selecting high-yield genotypes in both conditions, along with STI and GMP. The SC647 and KSC704 hybrids had more tolerance to stress and good yield potential in stressful and non-stressful conditions than did other hybrids (Correlation between tolerance index and performance under stress conditions in the flowering stage). In terms of average stress levels, the MP, HAR, and STI, which correlated with grain yield and stress conditions, were good criteria for selecting tolerance hybrids. GMP can be a suitable selection criterion in the case of ear stage under stress conditions. It concluded that the BC504 hybrid in the flowering stage and the KSC707 hybrid are the most sensitive hybrids to stress conditions in the ear stage. The KSC704 hybrid is the most tolerant hybrid in the flowering stage in stress conditions, and SC640 is the most tolerant hybrid in the ear stage in stress conditions. HAR was introduced as the best index for determining drought-tolerant hybrids due to its high correlation with grain yields. Choukan et al. [28] showed that performance has a positive and significant correlation with mean productivity, geometric mean, and harmonic mean in severe stress conditions. A high correlation was observed with grain yield at different stress levels for the indices of mean productivity, geometric mean, and harmonic mean in normal conditions. These indices were determined as the superior index for introducing drought-tolerant hybrid [29]. Fathi reported a significant correlation between STI and GMP and MP under normal conditions and drought stress [30]. Mostafavi et al. reported that the reduction in maize yield under water-stress conditions at the corolla emergence and pollination stage reaches about 90%. The leaf area of maize decreased due to drought stress depending on the intensity and length of the stress period, but the final number of leaves was less affected by stress [31]. Haji Babaei and Azizi investigated the effect of drought stress on the yield of maize hybrids. They reported that in normal and mild stress conditions, the most-used indices are GMP, MP and STI, and in normal and severe stress conditions, the most-used are the SSI and TOL [32].",

The first principal component showed positive and high MP, SSI, and Yp coefficients. Also, the second principal component has negative coefficients for all indices except TOL and Yp. It has high coefficients for the TOL index, Ys, and by increasing these components, genotypes selected are less sensitive to stress. Therefore, selection based on the first component causes the selection of hybrids with a high yield in normal conditions. The first principal component can be called the performance potential component, and the second principal component can be called the stress sensitivity component. Therefore, the first principal component can be considered a performance component and the second principal component as a sensitivity component (Principal components analysis of drought-stress and yield indices and Figure 2). Choukan et al. [28] reported that principal component analysis of the first and second principal components interpreted 96.3% of the changes in drought tolerance indices for stress conditions. The first component showed a high correlation with yields in normal conditions, and MP, GMP, HAR, and STI indices with yield potential. These were able to isolate high yield hybrids in stress conditions. Many researchers have reported a significant positive correlation between Yp and Ys, suggesting that high-yielding genotypes under normal conditions can perform well under stress conditions [33][34][35][36]. Refiq et al. [37] reported a significant positive correlation between 1000-grain weight and net grain yield in the plot.
