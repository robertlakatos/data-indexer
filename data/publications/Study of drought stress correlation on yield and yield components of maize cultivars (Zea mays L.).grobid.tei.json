          "text": "This article was investigated to study the correlation and analysis of drought stress regression on maize cultivars' yield and components. The variance analysis results showed a significant difference between drought stress levels in terms of plant height, total dry weight and number of seeds per row, the total weight of cob, grain yield, harvest index, stem diameter, and cob weight with protective leave. Also, there was a significant difference in ear weight without protective leaves, ear diameter, ear length, plant weight, 100-seed weight, and seed per ear on hybrid treatments. There were statistically significant differences between cultivars in plant height, leaf area, ear diameter, ear length, number of seeds per row, number of seeds per ear, the total weight of cob wood, 100-seed weight, harvest index, plant dry weight. The results of the correlation of traits for the mean levels of drought stress showed a positive and significant correlation between plant yield and plant height, seed per row, ear length and weight of 5 pieces of wood and also with a total weight of cob wood, ear weight with bark showed the highest correlation. There is a significant correlation between leaf area and stem diameter, plant weight, total dry weight at the probability level of 0.05. Correlation coefficients between traits in non-stress conditions showed a positive and significant correlation between grain yield and height, ear length and grain in the row, which was a significant increase compared to stress conditions. The correlation of traits under full stress conditions also showed that the correlation coefficient between cob length trait and positive height was positive and significant. From the study of correlation coefficients between maize traits in non-stress conditions, it can be concluded that the most important components of grain yield are cob length and grain per row. While the correlation coefficients under moisture stress conditions show that the grain trait in the row has a positive and significant correlation with yield, under stress conditions in the cob stage did not show any traits with correlation yield.",

          "text": "Corn (Zea mays L.) is one of the most important crops globally, so it plays a major role in providing food to many people around the world (Nagy, 2007). According to forecasts, by 2050, the demand for corn in developing countries will be almost double the current demand (Ort and Long, 2014). Environmental stresses such as water shortage (drought) are one of the main obstacles to the production of crops and horticulture in many parts of the world, especially arid and semi-arid regions such as Iran. The material is transferred back to the seed and reduces the yield due to the reduction of grain weight. Drought limits the photosynthesis of plants, which results in changes in the amount of chlorophyll and damage to the photosynthetic complex. In addition, drought stress limits photochemical activities and reduces the activity of enzymes in the Calvin cycle (Talaat, 2020). Water stress in maize has adverse effects on yield and yield components. Maize yield decreases by about 17% due to drought stress, but depending on the severity and timing of drought stress, this yield reduces to 80% (Hejazi et al., 2013). According to research, dehydration in the vegetative stage affects not only the leaves and stems but also the important developmental events of the corn plant, such as corolla emergence, ear silk, beginning and end of linear growth in grain filling, nitrate reduction and protein synthesis (Shojaei et al., 2016). According to Amini et al. (2014), in the cultivation of four-grain maize hybrids at different irrigation levels, the effect of irrigation levels on grain yield, biological yield, harvest index, 100-grain weight, number of grains per row, ear length and ear diameter was significant. However, irrigation had no significant effect on the number of rows per ear and the percentage of plant water. Differences between hybrids were also significant in grain yield, the number of rows per ear, 100-grain weight, biological yield, ear diameter and water content of the plant. In an experiment, Considering the issue of water scarcity as one of the major concerns of human societies, especially in arid and semi-arid regions including Iran, to complete the studies performed on corn, the present study aims to evaluate the effect of water stress on yield. Yield components of corn plant were done to be used in irrigation planning. If each performance component has a higher heritability than the performance and its correlation with the performance is positive, these components can be selected alone, to improve performance (Mousavi et al., 2019;Mousavi et al., 2020;Mousavi et al., 2021). Dolatabad et al. (2010) also conducted a study on 14 maize hybrids in nine regions to investigate the genotype-trait interaction and observed a high correlation between traits and grain yield. Choukan and Mosavat, 2005 reported a high and positive correlation between grain yield and number of grains per row, 1000-grain weight and the grain depth. Ramazani et al. (2008) also reported a correlation between grain yield and cob weight. Rafiq et al. (2010) found a positive and significant correlation between ear length, 1000-seed weight and grain weight per ear with grain yield. Alvi et al. (2003) showed that plant height, number of days to emergence, number of days to physiological maturity, ear length, number of seeds per row and 100-grain weight were directly related to grain yield. Phenotypic and genotypic correlation analysis of traits in maize hybrids in another experiment showed that grain yield had a significant correlation with plant height, ear height, the number of grains per row and number of days to emergence and the highest correlation with grain yield was related to the trait of height (Mousavi et al., 2020;Mahrokh et al., 2022). In a study of 12 commercial maize hybrids, Shojaei et al. (2021Shojaei et al. ( , 2022 a, b) a, b) reported a positive correlation between grain yield and ear length, number of rows per ear, 1000-seed weight and grain length.",

          "text": "The experiment was performed under field conditions as a split block with a randomized complete block design with 4 replications. Irrigation as the main factor in three levels including full irrigation, the stress in the emergence stage of tasseling and stress in the emergence stage of the ear and cultivars tested as a subfactor in 6 levels, including cultivars KSC704, KSC707, SC640, SC647, BC504, KSC260. The field experiment had 18 treatment combinations (6 3) and 4 replications and 72 experimental units. After implementing the plan in the experimental field, cultivation was done by drought (2 to 3 seeds were planted at a depth of 5 to 8 cm) and then irrigation was done. Each plot has 6 rows of planting with a length of 3 meters and a row spacing of 75 cm and between the plots 50 cm, i.e. one row in a row and 1 m spacing between repetitions to prevent water transfer during irrigation treatments considered. Planting was done in the form of ridge planting. The plant distance on the row was considered to be 20 cm. Land preparation operations included autumn plowing, supplementary spring plowing, disc plowing, and stacking. The experiment field was fallow in the year before the study. Planting the was accompanied by applying urea fertilizer and the first level of irrigation stress, i.e. stress in the emergence stage of the first corolla after irrigation for 15 days and in the emergence stage of the second level of irrigation stress began. To eliminate marginal effects from sampling in two side rows of each plot and also 0.5 m at the beginning and end of each row was omitted. A normality test was performed for all data before analysis of variance. Analysis of variance on the studied traits was performed in a field experiment based on strip plot design with randomized complete block design with MSTAT-C software and Duncan test was used to compare the means at 5% probability level. SPSS software was used to calculate simple correlation coefficients and regression analysis in terms of mean stress levels. Stepwise regression was used for this purpose.",

However, there was a statistically significant difference in the number of ears per plant. Among cultivars in terms of plant height, leaf area, ear diameter, ear length, number of grains per row, number of grains per ear, total weight of ear wood, 100-grain weight, harvest index, plant dry weight per surface (p≤0.01) and had a statistically significant difference in plant weight at the level (p≤0.05) but in terms of ear weight without protective leaves, ear weight with protective leaves, number of ears, stem diameter and grain yield were statistically significant. Statistically significant differences in traits indicate that the studied cultivars have genetic diversity in the above traits. Interaction of stress levels × cultivar for traits such as number of grains per row, ear weight, harvest index, total dry weight, plant height, stem diameter, ear weight with protective leaf and without protective leaf, plant weight, ear diameter, ear length and grains in the ear row had a statistically significant difference at the probability level (p≤0.01) and in terms of traits such as leaf area, grain yield at the level (p≤0.05) there was a statistically significant difference. Still, in terms of traits such as the number of ears the number of grains per ear and the weight of 100 grains were not statistically significant.

Correlation coefficients in water stress conditions show that the seed trait in the row has a positive and significant correlation with yield, but in the stress stage in the ear stage did not show any correlation with yield, so the grain trait in the row can be the most important plant characteristic to improve yield in conditions tensions should be noted. Regression analysis for mean stress levels showed that ear weight trait with high coefficient of determination with grain yield has a greater effect on grain yield and this shows that this trait has done high justification of yield.",
