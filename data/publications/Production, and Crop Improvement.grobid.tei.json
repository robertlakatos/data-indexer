This would assist in clarifying several questions of the indigenous cultures interactions with each other along with intrusive cultures, and it can propose a component of absolute dating into the chronology of archaeological deposits in the area. But, most of the methods for dating archaeological material in absolute terms cannot be used in the study of the ethno history of West Africa. The maize cob was extensively utilized in West Africa as a decorative roulette on pottery, generally on the coarser wares. So, the presence or absence of such decoration was used as a horizon in digging archaeological sites in West Africa. Furthermore, botanists have examined the genetics of maize in West Africa in detail, so that a statistical study of maize imitations on pottery, could allow the identification and relative location in time of variations in the maize population grown at a given site, and thus help to date the pottery (Willett, 1962).",

Although the wide summaries of diversity and dynamics of native maize populations were identified at the farm and national levels, these topics were not well known at the landscape level. The recent research suggests that apart from environmental factors which are the primary forces influencing the diver sity of the species in Mexico, current social origin, such as community of residence or ethnolinguistic group, also affects the maize population structure at more local levels. A landscape viewpoint can help to find out whether these social factors work in a constant manner through diverse environments. Brush and Perales (2007) used the data from the Chiapas Case study to exemplify the role of ethnicity in understanding the maize diversity ecology in Mexico. They found that the environmental varia tions are significant in ascertaining the general pattern of maize diversity across the Chiapan landscape but social origin has a substantial influence on maize populations in all environments.",

In this study, Perales et al. (2005) assessed the dispersal of maize (Zea mays) types among communities of two groups, the Tzeltal and Tzotzil. The results indicated that maize populations were separated as stated by ethnolinguistic group. But ethnolinguistic origin-based separation has not been clearly shown by an analysis of isozymes. A reciprocal garden experiment showed that the maize is well adapted to its environment; however, the Tzeltal maize occasionally outyields Tzotzil maize in Tzotzil environments. Due to the closeness of the two groups and selection for yield, it is assumed that the superior maize would dominate both groups' maize populations, but it was found that such domination is not the case. Thus, in relation to landrace differentiation, they discussed the role of ethnolinguistic diversity in determining social networks and information exchange.",

The normally used adaptation classifications such as temperate, Background and Importance of Maize tropical, subtropical, and highland are inaccurate. So, Pollak and Corbett (1993) applied multivariate statistical techniques to spatial geographic information system (GIS) datasets of agroclimatic data group from related maize-growing regions in Mexico and Central America. They used these groups to improve the mega-environments developed by CIMMYT maize breeders to help manage their germplasm. On the basis of each year's monthly data, mean monthly temperatures and precipitation, total precipi tation, and mode of the elevations in the grid, the variables such as mean maximum and minimum monthly air temperatures, absolute maximum and minimum air temperatures were analyzed. The cluster analysis was applied on 7 months of growing season data (April through October) to get 25 groups. Then, these 25 groups were categorized into 10 maize ecologies analogous to CIMMYT's mega-environments. The ecologies comprised three lowlands, three highlands, two subtropical, and two tran sitional from subtropical to highland. This technique would significantly help in categorizing and utilizing northern Latin America's large amount of diverse maize germplasm. Spedding et al. (2004) studied the long-term effect of tillage and residue management on soil microorganisms in a sandy loam to loamy sand soil of southwestern Quebec, by growing maize monoculture. No till, reduced tillage, and conventional tillage with crop residues either taken out from (-R) or retained on (+R) experimental plots were applied as treatments. At two depths viz 0-10 and 10-20 cm, soil microbial biomass carbon (SMB C), soil microbial biomass nitrogen (SMB-N) and phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) contents were assessed four times during the growing season. The magnitude of time influence was greater than those accredited to tillage or residue treatments. The SMB-N exhibited a high response to the postemergence application of mineral nitrogen, whereas SMB-C exhibited insignificant seasonal change (160 μg C g -1 soil) and PLFA analysis has shown a rise in fungi and total PLFA all over the season. PLFA profiles revealed a better difference between sampling time and depth than among treatments. In comparison, the +R plots exhibited a more pronounced residue effect with increased SMB-C (61%) and SMB-N (96%). These findings demonstrated that while evaluating soil quality on the basis of soil microbial components the seasonal variations in soil physical and chemical conditions should be taken into account. Hirasawa and Hsiao (1999) conducted a study to measure the maize leaf photosynthetic rate over diurnal courses on cloudless days with the leaf held perpendicular to the sunlight.",

The maximum leaf photosynthesis was recorded in the late morning on days of high atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and then reduced slowly as the day advanced, although the soil was well irrigated. In the measurement chamber when CO 2 concentration was increased to about 1000 μmol mol -1 , the higher photosynthesis was recorded in the afternoon than in the morning. However, a significant difference was not observed in the curves of photosynthetic rate (A) vs intercellular CO 2 concentration (C i ) for the morning and afternoon. Therefore, photosynthetic capacity was alike for the two periods and there was no proof of photo inhibition by the high photosynthetic photon flux density at noon. Additionally, C i and photosynthetic rates A quantified over different photon flux densities were lower in the afternoon than in the morning. These results specify that epidermal conductance (mostly stomatal) limits the photosynthetic rates A at noon and early afternoon. On a day with low VPD, midday depression in these results specifies that epidermal conductance (mostly stomatal) limits the photosynthetic rates A and which were not marked for the well-irrigated plants. However, in plants without irrigation and at lower midday water potential the reduction in conductance and photosynthetic rates A was much clearer, initiating late in the morning. Thus, they concluded that the low leaf water potential affected by high transpiration rates causes midday reduction in conductance and photosynthetic rates A.",

So, to determine the response of maize (Zea mays L.) to deficit irrigation Farré and Faci (2009) conducted two field trials on a loam soil in northeast Spain. All possible combinations of full irrigation or limited irrigation were applied as treatment in the three phases, that is, vegetative, flowering, and grain filling. Then, the interval between irrigations was increased to apply limited irrigation. Water status of soil, crop growth, above-ground biomass, yield, and its component traits were evaluated. Findings revealed that flowering is the most sensitive stage to water scarcity and water deficit at this stage results in higher biomass, yield, and harvest index reductions. Around flowering, treatments with deficit irrigation had significantly lower average grain yield than the well-irrigated treatments and the irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) was greater in fully irrigated treatments. During the grain filling phase, the deficit irrigation or higher interval between irrigations had no significant effect on crop growth and yield. These results indicate that in maize relatively high yields can be maintained if slight water deficits bring about by increasing the interval between irrigations were restricted to phases other than the flowering stage.",

In order to elucidate the causes of reductions in kernel number under the mild stresses typical of humid regions, more information on the responses of crop to water supply is needed. A field experiment was undertaken by Otegui et al. (1995) to measure crop evapotranspiration, E c , and its association with shoot biomass production, grain yield, and kernel number. To create differences in evaporative demand the experiment was conducted with two sowing dates (6 weeks apart). Then to create a 40-day period of reduced water supply during silking plastic covers were laid on the ground of water-deficit plots. Water deficit affected plant height, maximum leaf area index, and shoot biomass. Shoot biomass accumulation was associated with E c , but the water-stress treatments had greater water-use efficiencies (WUE). During the treatment period, grain yield was found to be associated to kernels m -2 (r = 0.88; 6 d.f.), and both grain yield and kernels m -2 were correlated with E c . Further, when fresh pollen was applied to late appearing silks, the number of kernels per ear did not increase indicating that ovaries which failed to expose their silks synchronously with pollen shedding were deleteriously influenced by water deficit.",

In order to study and measure associations among the variation of maize yield and agrometeorological disasters, and to assess the effects of drought disaster crop yield-climate analysis and regression analysis were used. The data on historical climate, crop yield, crop sown area, crop damaged area, and crop loss was collected from 41 maize-producing districts of Songliao Plain. It was found that among all agrometeorological disasters, drought occurs with the greatest frequency, covers the largest area, and brings about the greatest loss to agricultural production, and the economy in the region. The negative value years of the maize yield variation because of agrometeorological disasters accounted for 55%, of which 60% was affected by drought. The negative values of maize yield variation were significantly and positively associated with drought affected areas, indi cating the adverse effects of drought on maize production are comparable to the magnitude of damage caused by drought disasters. On the basis of drought disaster risk extent to maize, the Songliao Plain was separated into four subregions: high risk zone, medium risk zone, low risk area, and slight risk zone by applying fuzzy cluster analysis. It revealed that the risk degree of drought disaster in the Songliao Plain rises progressively from south to north and from east to west. The results of this study can be used as a base to develop strategies to lessen drought and reduce losses and ensure sustainable agricultural development. Cross and Zuber (1972) undertook an evaluation of different thermal unit formulas to find better ways of assessing relative maturity variances in corn (Zea mays L.). Around 22 different methods of thermal units were computed for their capacity to elucidate variation in flowering dates by using data from six plantings of corn over a 2-year period. Hourly as well as daily temperature data were utilized in the equations. On the whole, the daily measurements seemed to be roughly as accurate as the hourly measurements. The best thermal units equation for predicting flowering dates used a base temperature of 10°C (50°F) and an optimal of 30°C (86°F). Therefore, to calculate high temperature stress, the excess temperature above 30°C should be deducted.",

The factorization of market-mediated responses and by-product utilized in the analysis reduced cropland change by 72% from the land utilized for the ethanol feedstock. Subsequently, the related GHG emission assessed in the background was 800 g of carbon dioxide per megajoule (MJ); in 30 years of ethanol production, or approximately one fourth of the other available assessments of emissions were attributed to variations in unintended land use. However, 800 g is sufficient to negate the advantages that corn ethanol has on global warming, thus reducing its probable contribution in the context of California's Low Carbon Fuel Standard.",

A significant genotypic variation was observed among these traits and a positive association was noticed among nitrate content, GS activity and yield, and its components. Conversely, NR activity had a negative association with other traits. These findings reveal that the capability of maize to store nitrate in their leaves during vegetative growth and to effectively remobilize this stored nitrogen during grain filling is responsible for improved productivity in maize genotypes. They searched and located the quantitative trait loci (QTL) for different agronomic and physiological traits on the genetic map of maize. Concurrences of QTL for yield and its component traits with genes encoding cytosolic GS and the subsequent enzyme activity were identified. It was found that the GS locus on chromosome 5 is a useful candidate gene that can partly elucidate differences in yield or kernel weight. Since at GS locus concurrence of QTLs for grain yield, GS, NR activity, and nitrate content were also detected, they assumed that accumulation of leaf nitrate and the reactions catalyzed by NR and GS are co-regulated and are the main elements regulating nitrogen use efficiency in maize.",

Initially, the literature on smallholder adaptation in Mexico was reviewed, and then policy and institutional problems influencing adaptation at the farm-level were discussed.

Further, they studied the effect of various planting dates on the performance of maize under rainfed and irrigated conditions. The CSM-CERES-Maize assessment has shown that the model can simulate phenology and grain yield for the four hybrids precisely, with less than 15% of standardized RMSE. The planting date analysis revealed that in all hybrids a delayed planting date from February 1 to April 15 reduced the average yield by 55% and 21% for the rainfed and irrigated conditions, respectively. The yield forecasting analysis showed that a precise yield prediction could be given at around 45 days before harvesting for all four maize hybrids. These findings have potential for farmers and decision makers, as they could get precise yield forecasts before the final harvest. But, to make practical decisions for stock management of maize grains, this method should be developed for different locations.

In this region, the sympatric origin or selection in maize for the Mv resistance mutant was expected to cause its integration in all seven Caribbean maize races. Around the eighth century, it was estimated that viruliferous leafhoppers were blown from the Caribbean into the Petén leading to an epidemic of disease in susceptible maize races such as Nal-Tel and Tepecintle, cultivated by the Petén Maya. Continuous failure of maize production because of MMV would have distinguished areas of intensive maize cultivation, mainly where it was year-round. The disease would have been less serious in areas with a long dry season, such as north Yucatán and it would not have arisen in the highland areas to the south and west, areas to which surviving Maya probably migrated (Brewbaker, 1979).

Aldrich and Leng (1965) in the book on Modern Corn Production have mentioned that the early drive to enhanced productivity is principally attributable to the development of hybrid varieties. However, the more recent advance in maize crop yields is chiefly the resultant of the improvements that occurred in the maize crop production techniques. Though the development of hybrid varieties has been comprehensively recognized, nevertheless it is only in recent times that ample accounts were published comprehensively of the innovations in methods of crop production. The results of recent research on various aspects of maize production were presented in a series of review articles in Advances in Corn Production (F.C.A. 20: 1422). The book is essentially a distillation of the data for the practicing farmer. They have produced a survey of modern maize production techniques in the Corn Belt States of America. Opening the discussion on maize with a general account of its growth and development from sowing to harvest, they later discussed the farming system, choice of variety, seedbed prepa ration, sowing, fertilizer requirements, water management, weed control, pests and diseases, feeding quality, prospects, etc. Although their approach throughout was in the form of a description of the practical methods for calibrating drills, sampling for soil and tissue tests, and identifying pests (including dishonest salesmen), recent research results are incorporated and discussed. Minimum cultivation techniques are flattering more and more popular and are being applicable in many areas in the Corn Belt. The commercial productions of maize are much oriented toward the earlier sowing, narrower drill rows, and higher plant populations. With changes in the design of farm machinery that has taken place and is continuing the authors believed that the erstwhile norm of 42-in. drill rows and 12-15 thousand plants per acre will soon be superseded by 30-in. drill rows and 24-28 thousand plants per acre. With the introduction of new technologies and research coupled with the innovative farming experiences on losses at harvest, combine fitted with a maize attachment may begin to replace the corn pickers. Further, previously there is the former practice of leaving the maize crop in the field until the grain moisture content was (22-25%) for the ears to be stored in cribs. This practice seems to be changing to harvesting the maize much earlier (30% grain moisture) and adopting the artificial drying methods of grain drying or storing it wet in sealed containers. It is evident that every facet of production, from seedbed World Maize Production preparation to harvesting and storing the crop as grain or silage has been the topic of intensive study in recent years. The book provides the maize farmer and advisory officer in the Corn Belt States of America with a fair and balanced appraisal of the present and potential effects of this research on farming practice.",

Thus in this region, taking up the maize planting at an appro priate time in the growing season is very critical for attaining good hybrid maturity lengths and optimized yields. Many crop models were designed for determining in a locality the optimum windows of planting. Anapalli et al. (2005) calibrated the plant parameters of the RZWQM and genetic coefficients for the CERES-Maize model. They validated the performance of these models against experimental data of three corn hybrids that had exhibited variations in days to maturity and planted at three planting dates in 2 years at Akron, CO, under irrigation. Keeping in view the similar levels of accuracy in both these models they have calibrated them for prediction of leaf area index, soil water content, crop water use, and yield. The results have shown that there was a simulated drop in yield with late planting dates in both models though CERES-Maize simulated the yield from the latest planting date at a much accurate level for all three hybrids than did RZWQM (13% under predicted by CERES-Maize; 50% over predicted by RZWQM). They suggested through the use of a long-term Akron weather record that the most up-to-date planting dates for the short-, mid-, and long-season hybrids to have a 50% probability of attaining a breakeven yield under irrigation to be as 13 May, 20 May, and 6 May, respectively. Further, the results of long-term simulations have revealed that with delay in planting dates the hybrids with longer periods of maturity lengths would lose yields much faster rather than those with the short maturity length. Finally, their research highlights indicated that this information which has been produced by either RZWQM or CERES-Maize will be of much use in having decisions relating to both the planting and replanting in northeastern Colorado of corn hybrids varying in their maturity lengths.",

It is one of Tanzania's most dependent maize producers. He explored specific issues of importance like farm size, education, and access to main inputs such as seeds, fertilizers, and agricultural extension services on the basis of data that has been gathered from three districts of Rukwa. The exploration results revealed that in most household's livelihoods maize crop had an important role to play, though its production levels were much low. An important factor concerned with bringing about an increase in yields is education. Some of the nonagricultural policies may also be vital to bring improvements in the productivity and welfare of farmers. In spite of its importance to household livelihoods, quite a lot of limitations were reported to impede its productivity including access to fertilizers, improved seeds, and other chemical inputs required for higher production and extension services. Hassan et al. (2014) used the secondary annual data of the periods of 1971-2010, and by using the OLS method analyzed the maize total factor productivity growth. They also used the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) that was based on Malmquist Index in Nigerian. By the OLS method they identified the factors affecting the maize productivity. Their analysis results have shown that total the factor productivity value was 1.004 for the 40-year period of maize production. The factor had a growth of 0.4%. Further, these results indicated that the country had recorded the total factor productivity growth of ≥1.00 that held at 43.6%, while 56.4% of the time studied the country had a decrease in maize total factor productivity growth. It has proved the inputs growth instead of an output growth. Apart from this, a regress of -3.5% was seen in the total factor productivity growth from 1971 to 1975, nevertheless from 1986 to 1990, there was 3.7% of maize productivity growth in the country.

Jordaan and Grové (2007) utilized a logistic regression for analyzing the factors affecting the choice of respondents in forward pricing methods during the season of maize production. Based on the results, it is assessed that minor levels of risk aversion and high levels of human capital are associated with the usage of forward pricing. They have employed the factor analysis for reducing the dimensionality of the personal reasons. These would be of help in interpreting the identical and similar factor that is behind the personal reasons of farmers being reluctant in using the forward pricing methods. They identified three factors viz deficiencies of capacity, distrust of the market, and the dreadful experiences. The outcomes from the factor analysis validate the finding that farmers require superior levels of human capital to use forward pricing methods. Further, they also don't consider that the method of forward pricing seems effective. They thus suggested that education be supposed to focus additionally on the practical application of option forward pricing methods and not solely on the profits of forward pricing methods utilization.",

It is predicted that those regions which were currently are the short-rains season (October-January) are likely to the incidence of augmented rainfall, while those of the long rains season (April-July) will illustrate a decline in the rainfall. In zone III areas, the yields of maize are predicted to a reduction rather than those of zone IV areas which show increased yields. On the other hand, their predicted variations in yield changes were very meager, as these were below 500 kg ha -1 , in many regions of Kenya, except at the Homa Bay site.

Maize has undergone a particularly remarkable transformation. Researchers worked for decades to find the genes that lie behind maize evolution, but these works have been limited in scope. In this chapter, a broad assessment of the evolution of modern maize was reported based on the genome-wide resequencing of 75 wild, landrace, and superior maize lines. They found evidences of recovery of diversity after domestication, likely introgression from wild relatives, and proof for stronger selection during domestication than improvement. They identified a number of genes with stronger signals of selection than those formerly shown to bring about major morphological variations. Lastly, through transcriptome-wide analysis of gene expression, they found evidence both reliable with removal of cis-acting variation during maize domestication and improvement and suggestive of modern breeding having improved dominance in expression while targeting highly expressed genes (Hufford et al., 2012).",

Instead, the findings indicated that all maize developed from a single domestication in southern Mexico about 9000 years ago. Further, the analyses indicated that the oldest enduring maize types are those of the Mexican highlands with maize dispersing from this region over the Americas along two main paths. The phylogenetic work is in harmony with a model based on the archaeological record signifying that maize diversified in the highlands of Mexico before spreading to the lowlands.

To comprehend the influ ence of selection during maize domestication, nucleotide polymorphism in teosinte branched1 (tb1), a gene involved in maize evolution was examined. Wang et al.

The factor regulating the phenotypic variance between maize and teosinte maps to a 1-kb region, within which maize and teosinte show only seven predetermined variations in their DNA sequences. One of these variations encodes a nonconservative amino acid substitution and may affect protein function, and the other six variations potentially affect gene regulation.

Genetic studies have made available strong proof that maize was domesticated from Balsas teosinte (Z. mays ssp. parviglumis), a wild relative that is endemic to the mid-to lowland regions of southwestern Mexico. An interesting paradox remains; however, maize cultivars that are most closely associated with Balsas teosinte are located mainly in the Mexican highlands where subspecies parviglumis do not grow. Genetic data thus point to the initial diffusion of domesticated maize from the highlands rather than from the region of initial domestication. The latest archeological evidence for early lowland cultivation has been consistent with the genetics of domestication, leaving the issue of the ancestral position of highland maize unresolved. Here, a new SNP dataset scored in a large number of accessions of both teosinte and maize was used to take a second look at the geography of the most primitive cultivated maize. It was observed that gene flow between maize and its wild relatives meaningfully impact our inference of geographic origins. By examining differentiation from inferred ancestral gene frequencies, they got results that are fully in agreement with present ecological, archeological, and genetic data relating to the geography of early maize cultivation (Van Heerwaarden et al., 2011).",

The results unveiled a modest shortage of diversity in the maize genome comparative to teosinte. The relative shortage of diversity is less for SSRs with dinucleotide repeat motifs than for SSRs with repeat motifs of more than two nucleotides, signifying that the former with their higher mutation rate have partly recovered from the domestication bottleneck. The association between SSR diversity and proximity to QTL for domestication traits was analyzed and association was not found between these factors. But, a weak, though significant, spatial correlation was observed for diversity statistics among SSRs within 2 cM of one another, indicating that SSR diversity is weakly patterned across the genome. Twenty-four of 462 SSRs (5%) reveal some indication of positive selection in maize under multiple tests.

A prominent example of this phenomenon is observed in maize (Z. mays spp. mays), which shows a profound increase in apical dominance compared with its likely wild ancestor, teosinte (Z. mays ssp. parviglumis). Earlier research has recognized the tb1 gene as a key contributor to this evolutionary trans formation in maize. Doebley et al. (1997) cloned tb1 by transposon tagging and showed that it encodes a protein with homology to the cycloidea gene of snapdragon. The pattern of tb1 expression and the morphology of tb1 mutant plants suggested that tb1 acts both to repress the growth of axillary organs and to facilitate the formation of female inflorescences. The maize allele of tb1 is expressed at twice the level of the teosinte allele, signifying that gene controlling variations lie behind the evolutionary divergence of maize from teosinte. Domesticated maize and its wild ancestor (teosinte) differ markedly in morphology and provide an opportunity to assess the association between strong selection and diversity in a main crop species. The tb1 gene mainly regulates the increase in apical dominance in maize comparative to teosinte, and a region of the tb1 locus 5′ to the transcript sequence was a target of selection during maize domestication. To better characterize the influence of selection at a key \"domestication\" locus, Clark et al. (2004) sequenced the upstream tb1 genomic region and systematically sampled nucleotide diversity for sites located as far as 163 kb upstream to tb1. Their studies defined a selective sweep of about 60-90 kb 5′ to the tb1-transcribed sequence. The selected region harbors a combination of unique sequences and large repetitive elements, but it holds no predicted genes. Diversity at the nearest 5′ gene to tb1 is characteristic of that for neutral maize loci, representing that selection at tb1 had the least effect on the adjacent chromosomal region. Further, results showed low intergenic linkage disequilibrium in the region and suggested that selection had a negligible role in shaping the pattern of linkage disequilibrium observed. In brief, the study increases the likelihood that maize-like tb1 haplotypes are present in extant teosinte populations, and their results also suggested a model of tb1 gene regulation that varies from traditional opinions of how plant gene expression is regulated.",

This unassuming grass might easily have been ignored, were it not for the hand of nature that beckoned with abundant variation, a gift not lost on early agriculturists. Within the last 10,000 years, early Native Americans were able to transform teosinte into a plant whose ear, bursting with row upon row of exposed kernels, feeds the world over. It was a transformation so striking and so complex that some would not believe it probable, leading to years of competing theory and intense debate. But as Darwin himself accepted, when human desires collide with the diversity of nature, the result can be great indeed.

This chapter reviews that evidence in light of some different domestication assumptions.

Maize (Z. mays L. ssp. mays) was domesticated from its wild progenitor teosinte (Z. mays ssp. parviglumis) through a specific domestication event in southern Mexico between 6000 and 9000 years ago. This domestication event leads to original maize landrace varieties. The landraces make available the genetic material for modern plant breeders to select improved varieties and inbred lines by improving traits regulating agricultural productivity and performance. Artificial selection during domestication and crop improvement involved the selection of specific alleles at genes regulating main morphological and agronomic traits, resulting in decreased genetic diversity comparative to unselected genes. In this review, research on the identification and characterization by population genetics methods of genes affected by artificial selection in maize was summarized. Analysis of DNA sequence diversity at a large number of genes in a sample of teosintes and maize inbred lines showed that about 2% of maize genes reveal evidence of artificial selection. The remaining genes provide evidence of a population bottleneck related to domestication and crop improvement. In a further study to efficiently find selected genes, the genes with zero sequence diversity in maize inbreds were selected as potential targets of selection and sequenced in diverse maize landraces and teosintes, resulting in approximately half of candidate genes showing evidence for artificial selection. Extended gene sequencing demonstrated a low false-positive rate in the approach. The selected genes have functions consistent with agronomic selection for plant growth, nutritional quality, and maturity. Large-scale screening for artificial selection permits the detection of genes of potential agronomic significance even when gene function and the phenotype of interest are unknown. These methods should also be appro priate for other domesticated species if precise demographic conditions during domestication exist (Yamasaki et al., 2007).",

In Z. mays, morphological, genetic, and genomic studies have explained how a wild plant, the teosinte Z. mays subsp. parviglumis, was transformed into the domesticate Z. mays subsp. mays. Five key morphological variances differ entiate these two subspecies, and careful genetic dissection has identified the molecular changes accountable for several of these traits.

Then they analyzed whether this event was associated with the existence of methylated domains. Though it was not, it is still probable that another form of epigenetic mark, such as histone modification, may well be at play. The researchers noted that, from an evolutionary viewpoint, biased fractionation makes lots of sense. A mutation that deactivates one homeolog automatically sets strong selective pressure against a debilitating mutation on the other. Alternatively, constant mutations on the previously inactivated chromosome can not do any more harm. Finally, the selection (natural or otherwise) forces remove the extra DNA from the tetraploid and creates new combinations and associations to face its everchanging environment and, in maize's case, meet evergrowing demands to make available food and fuel to an increasing human population.",

To a large extent, the cells which contribute to indeterminate fates are localized in the meristems, much of these are pluripotent cells. These pluripotent cells are involved in the production of lateral organs. Those meristematic cells which were found at the intercalary stem tissue are responsible in providing the cells for the internodal growth, while those existing along the leaf margins are mostly responsible for bringing about an increase in the leaf width. Zhang et al. (2018a) have identified a mutant in maize that exhibited a defect between the determinacy and indeterminacy balance. This mutant of maize had shorter internodes with more narrowed leaves. They mentioned that the production of these narrowed leaves in this mutant was due to a decline in indeterminate cells in the leaf and also in the stem. In particular, in the shoot meristems, these mutants were a complete failure in controlling the indeterminacy. Though the meristems of the inflorescence were fasciated and determinate in nature, those of axillary meristems were indeterminate. They identified a responsible gene for this type of architecture in maize that was the growth-regulating factor, interacting factor1 (gif1), through the analysis of positional cloning. The mRNA transcripts of this gene were found to be accumulated to a large extent at discrete domains of the meristems in the shoot. In addition, through RNA-seq analysis they found that those genes involved in the architecture of the maize inflorescence were also differentially expressed in the gif1.

PIN-FORMED (PIN) proteins regulate auxin spatiotemporal asymmetric distribution in several plant developmental processes. Overexpression of ZmPIN1a in maize increased the number of lateral roots (LR) and reduced their elongation, forming a developed root system with longer seminal roots and denser LR. Further, it decreased plant height, internode length, and ear height. This alteration of the maize phenotype improved the yield under high-density cultivation conditions, and the developed root system enhanced plant resistance to drought, lodging, and a low-phosphate environment. Determination of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) concentration, transport capacity, and application of external IAA showed that overexpression of ZmPIN1a led to increased IAA transport from shoot to root. The buildup of auxin in the root facilitated the plant to apportion more carbohydrates to the roots, improved the growth of the root, and enhanced plant resistance to environmental stress. These results make evidence that root breeding could improve maize plant architecture to create an ideal phenotype for further yield increases (Li et al., 2018). Thompson et al. (2015) in two divergent populations of maize mapped the genetic architecture of their shoot meristems. They found that the meristem architecture is two divergent populations of maize is population specific.

They performed the joint-linkage mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTL), fine mapping in near-isogenic lines (NILs), genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP). Through these studies, it was found that the heritability of maize height was around 90%. There was a large variation in plant height in the maize lines of NAM family-nested QTL. The variation in height ranged from 2.1-0.9%. Validation of two tropical alleles by fine mapping at this QTL in NIL families indicated that there was a considerable linkage by GWAS colo calized with established height loci, comprising brass-inosteroid-deficient dwarf1, dwarf plant1, and semidwarf2. Further, GBLUP explained 80% of height variation in the panels. It also outperformed bootstrap aggregation of family-nested QTL models in evaluations of prediction accuracy. Thus, these research findings have indicated that maize height architecture is under high polygenic control and is heritably under strong genetic control.",

Their findings have shown that of the total leaf number, in maize, those leaves which are above the primary ear and those below the primary ear are considerably under independent genetic control. They suggested that during domestication and improvement, these might have been subjected to differential directional selection. They revealed that two traits, namely, the flowering time and the leaf number in maize are usually regulated at a modest level. Furthermore, they have revealed that in these inbred lines, flowering time and leaf number are usually regulated at a modest level. In these, by near isogenic analysis, they have validated the pleiotropy of the genes ZCN8, dlf1, and ZmCCT on the leaf number and also on flowering time.

The phenes associated with size such as diameter and number were found to be considerably influenced by nodal position.

Earlier research findings have shown that other loci may also function epistatically with tb1 and might also be accountable for some of its phenotypic effects. Dong et al.

Additionally, the nucleotide diversity surveys have indicated that tru1, like tb1, was also a target of selection. TRU1 has its expression largely in leaf vasculature of axillary internodes in modern maize; however, the expression of this in teosinte, was absent or largely declined.

This mapping has shown that these traits are connected closely with many varied genetic architectural features involved in the inflorescence development.

In this mutant, the pleiotropic mutations that occurred had their effect on the leaf length, width, angle as well as internodal length and diameter in plants. In the Mo17 inbred line, they found that a natural variation has occurred at the drl2 enhancer locus that resulted in the declined expression of drl2-Mo17 alleles, and the phenotypes that resulted were highly enhanced. Another allele (drl2) has been produced with the transposon mutagenesis. This allele exhibited synergistic interactions with the drl1 mutants and has resulted in a decline in the expression of transcript levels of drl2. These findings have indicated that in maize, for the attainment of a proper and desired leafing pattern and the development and the proliferation of leaf supporting tissues, as well as for the restriction of the expansion of the auricle at the region of leaf midrib, the requisite of the presence of drl genes is essential. In maize, the CRABS CLAW coorthologs are encoded largely by the paralogous loci, belonging to the YABBY family of genes acting as transcriptional regulators. Coexpression of drl1 genes was seen to a large extent in the budding and emergent leaf primordia at the region of shoot apex. Their expression was not detected in these incipient leaf primordia arising at the vegetative meristem or meristems of stem. In NAM-RIL populations, the genome-wide studies have shown that the loci of drl reside within the regions of quantitative trait locus for leaf angle, leaf width, and internode length. For traits of leaf width and internodal length, in maize, the leaf has a proximal sheath, enabling in stem grip and a distal long leaf blade. Both the leaf sheath and the leaf blade are attached by an auricle and a membranous ligule. This hinge-like region enables the leaf blade and the supporting midrib to bend far away from the stem. This bending gives maize an architecture that has an effect on the yield (Lockhart, 2017). In general, widespread analyses of liguleless (lg) mutants have revealed the important roles of the lg genes in establishing the blade-sheath boundary (Johnston et al., 2014), though their downstream targets were yet to be revealed. Strable et al. (2017) discovered another highly informative maize mutant, drl1. The leaves of drl1 droop downward due to decreased midrib development and show increased leaf angle because of distal extension of the auricle along the blade-sheath boundary. In addition, drl1-R (the reference allele of drl1) has shorter, narrower leaf blades and longer proximal sheaths than the wild type, along with long, slender internodes. These phenotypes are specifically marked in the existence of the unlinked genetic modifier drl2-Mo17. Similarly, the Transposon mutagenesis has discovered a second allele of drl2 that interacted synergistically with drl1 in a dose-sensitive manner. The maize drl1 and drl2 loci encode CRABS CLAW-like transcription factors in the YABBY family (Bowman and Smyth, 1999). The YABBY genes were found to have vital roles in the development of leaf lamina in many species, though their role in maize has yet to be clarified. However, Juarez et al. (2004) has suggested that these genes are helpful in directing the outgrowth of the leaf blade. Lockhart (2017) by means of a nested association mapping population (NAM) of ~5000 recombinant inbred lines, by GWAS determined whether the two loci, namely, drl1 and drl2 loci colocalize with some of the agronomically significant QTL. Further, an analysis of the association of SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) with the earlier generated phenotypic data that arose from the natural variation in the NAM population has revealed that drl1 and drl2 are indeed located in important QTL regions for stem and leaf traits and that quite a lot of unusual SNPs have large phenotypic effects on these traits have recognized unusual single nucleotide polymorphisms, having huge phenotypic effects.",

Positional cloning and revertant analysis have revealed that wab1 encoded a TCP transcription factor. Tassel branches were less and more in upright stature in the wab1 revertant tassel. In the dominant mutant, these tassel branches had an increased branch angle. They detected that wab1 mRNA was expressed at the base of branches in the inflorescence. This expression was required for the expression of LG1. Though the expression of wab1 was lacking in the leaves, its expression was found to be present in the dominant mutant. They mentioned that though wab1 is not obligatory for induction of lg1 expression in the maize leaf, its expression is required for counteracting the severe phenotype of the dominant Wab1-R mutant. Thus, this regulatory interaction of LG1 and WAB1 revealed the presence of a link between that of maize leaf shape and the architecture of tassel and has suggested that ligule acts as a boundary identical to that present at the base of the lateral organs.",

Vast information is available on the QTL controlling leaf angle of maize. Ku et al.

They mapped the QTLs and evaluated these lines at three varied environments. Out of the 20 QTLs that were detected, only 5 QTLs could explain about 53.9% of the phenotypic variance for narrowed leaf angle and optimum leaf orientation. They identified two major genome regions involved in the control of leaf angle and leaf orientation, qLA1 and qLOV1 at adjacent marker umc2226 on chromosome 1.02 accounted for 20.4 and 23.2% of the phenotypic variance, respectively; qLA5 and qLOV5 at nearest bnlg1287 on chromosome 5 accounted for 9.7% and 9.8% of the phenotypic variance, respectively. These findings were valuable for marker-assisted selection in enhancing the performance of maize plants and improved yields under high-density plantings for increasing the amount of light capture per unit area of land. Wei et al. (2016) in a study identified the QTL for traits associated with maize leaf area. They found these QTLs across three environments in a set of recombinant inbred lines, through the usage of 1226 single nucleotide polymorphic markers.

Among these, five of the QTL elucidated 46.02%, seven of them elucidated 46.77%, and four QTL elucidated 30.03% of the phenotypic variance of maize leaf length, width and area.

A wide range of data sets were used for the study to unveil the importance of these in supporting leaf blade. At the stage of maturity, a dynamic change in the leaf sheath transcriptome was evident. This transcriptome change was due to the buildup of basic cell structures at the initial and early stages of leaf sheath maturation and these later transitioned to synthesis in the cell-wall components and other modifications. This transcriptome has revealed a change at the last stage of the maturation of the leaf sheath in relation to photosynthesis and lignin biosynthesis. In maize, the biological functions of various tissues are largely specialized. A higher expression of 15 genes in leaf sheath was identified.

In general, the phenotypic screening studies take into consideration the root attributes of young plants as the main criteria of screening trait. Singh et al.

The study revealed that maize produces three to seven seminal roots comprising of the primary and scutellum roots and that of the coleoptile nodal roots when it is at the second leaf stage. The absorptive capacity of a plant is dependent on the complex organization of the root system. Maize root architecture, cell-cycle proteins, and production of heat-shock proteins were studied with reference to the auxin-induced changes in seedlings of maize which were raised from the embryonic axes by Martínez-de la Cruz et al. (2015). Their results have shown that in the initial stages, namely, during the first few days after germination, the seedlings of maize have developed many types of root types exhibiting a simultaneous growth. However, it was observed that its post-embryonic root development had begun with the development of the PR and seminal scutellar roots. Later there was the formation of adventitious CR, brace roots (BR), and LR. The root architecture of maize was influence by auxins in a dose-response pattern. Among the various auxins evaluated, the crown root formation was stimulated to a large extent by NAA and IBA. A large repressive effect on root growth was seen with the application of 2,4-D.

Molecular cloning of these genes has shown that some of the chief elements involved in auxin signal trans duction, namely, LBD domain and Aux/IAA proteins, are key instrumental elements for the initiation of seminal, shoot-borne, and lateral root initia tion. In addition, the genetic analyses have confirmed that genes connected to exocytotic vesicle docking, cell wall loosening, and cellulose synthesis and organization also regulate the elongation of root hair. The detection of upstream regulators, protein interaction partners, and downstream targets of these genes together with cell-type-specific transcriptome analyses have made available new insights into the regulatory networks involved in the control of root development and root architecture of maize. Salvi et al. (2016) in a group of introgression lines of maize obtained from a reference line B73 and the landrace Gaspe Flint dissected the genetic architecture and root diversity in these lines during the early stages of root development. They have identified three QTLs involved in the control of seminal root numbers on the chromosome bins 1.02, 3.07, and 8.04-8.05. They could explain 66% of the phenotypic variation in these lines. Further, it was revealed that the allele for the lowest seminal root number in all the three chromosome bins was largely contributed from Gaspe Flint. A negative correlation was found to exist between the dry weight of PR and the seminal root number (r = -0.52). Furthermore, co-mapping of QTLs for PR size with seminal root number QTLs, has shown that these seminal root number QTLs had a pleiotropic effect on the seminal root number of PR. They mentioned that this pleiotropic effect might have been resulted due to the competition for seed resources. Interestingly, two out of three SRN QTLs co-mapped with the only two known genes (rtcs and rum1) of maize, that were affecting the number of seminal roots have indicated the presence of a strong additive effect of the three QTLs. They mentioned that the development of NILs for each QTL in the elite B73 background enables the provision of distinc tive opportunities for characterizing the functional genes involved in the root development of maize. It also provides an opportunity to assess the effects of root architectural traits on the seedling establishment, early development, and maize yields. Giuliani et al.

It has indicated that lateral root growth is more influenced by environmental effects. Stage I, namely, root establishment had a closer relationship with grain yield. They detected 30 QTLs for RSA in this BC4F3 population. In the maturation stage, only 13.3% of QTLs were detected. It was found that most of these QTLs were located on chromosome 6 near the locus umc1257 (bin 6.02-6.04) at the establishment stage, on chromosome 10 near the locus umc2003 (bin 10.04) for the number of Axial roots across all three developmental stages. The regions of chromosome 7 near the locus bnlg339 (bin 7.03) and chromosome 1 near the locus bnlg1556 (bin 1.07) harbored QTLs for both grain yield and lateral root related traits at the establishment stage and silking stages, respectively.

These QTLs were validated also through the analysis of transgenic analysis and a GWAS. The results have shown that only 16% of the total genetic variation found for the nodal root number has been found to be derived from those QTLs for plant height. Thus, their findings have suggested that in maize, the flowering time has a key vital part to play in determining nodal root number via its indirect selection during the domestication of maize. Furthermore, the results have also indicated and supported that in temperate maize, root architecture has the presence of more aerial nodal roots and fewer cown roots, which favors the improve ment of temperate maize root lodging resistance and also enhances its ability to extract water and nitrogen present in the deeper layers of soil, particularly under high-density planting systems.",

Proteomic changes in single-cell-type root hairs were also surveyed. Additionally, these proteomic changes were also surveyed in the PRs for their developmental changes, in dissimilar tissues as the meristematic zone, the elongation zone as well as stele and cortex of the differentiation zones to provide an insight into the multifaceted proteomic interactions of the maize RSA. Trachsel et al.

The visual score was based on the score of root numbers, angles and branching pattern of crown and BR. They evaluated these traits in these inbred populations at the flowering stage. They mentioned that time taken for the visual score of a sample was only two minutes. Visual scoring of root crowns have given a reliable estimate of values for these traits of root architecture, specified by high correlations between measured and visually scored trait values for numbers (r 2 = 0.46-0.97), angles (r 2 = 0.66-0.76), and branching (r 2 = 0.54-0.88) of brace and CR. On the basis of this visual evaluation of root traits of CR, they were able to discriminate the populations. The results revealed that more number of roots, with the highest branching density, shallow root angles were more prominent in the RILs which were derived from the cross NY821 × H99. However, in inbred lines of the cross between OH43 × W64a the root angles were very steep. Similarly, better correlations were seen in the visual scoring of the BR rather than that of the CR.

Light attenuation in row crop grown plants as maize is to a large extent governed by the canopy architecture. The cultural operations have an influence in improving the efficiency of light inter ception as they affect and modify the canopy architecture. Maddonni et al. (2001) evaluated in Argentina, the response of four maize hybrids to variable population densities and row spacing in the production of leaf growth as well as light attenuation. Variation in plant population densities in these maize hybrids resulted in large variations in the production of shoot organs. From the initial stages of crop growth, only the influence of population and row spacings were evident on the leaf growth (V 6 -V 8 ) and that of azimuthal orientation (V 10 -V 11 ). Modification of shoot size and orientation of leaves revealed the prevalence of shade avoidance reac tions, which were thought to have been probably due to the triggering by a reduction in the red:far-red ratio of light within the canopy. One of the hybrids displayed a random azimuthal distribution and was designated as a rigid hybrid. However, even at very low plant population densities, there was a modified azimuthal distribution of leaves. This was evident in these hybrids in response to plant rectangularity. Such hybrids were designated as plastic in nature. There was no variation in the light attentuation in these hybrids after the attainment of the maximum leaf area index. However, it was found that a more uniform plant distribution resulted in an increase in light attenuation (k coefficient: 0.37-0.49) only when crop canopies have not attained the critical leaf area index values. Perez et al. (2019) mentioned that breeders often select for traits contributing to yield. They tested the effect of breeding on a variety of traits which were included in determining the maize plant architecture and light interception, by an analysis in a panel of sixty maize hybrids released from 1950 to 2015. Their study was on the basis of new traits, which were calculated from reconstructions obtained from a phenotyping platform. They assessed the contribution of these traits to light interception in virtual field canopies composed of 3D plant reconstructions, with a model tested in a real field. They found that two categories of traits had varied contributions to genetic progress, namely, (i) the vertical distribution of maize leaf area which exhibited a high heritability and has shown a noticeable trend over generations of selection. The leaf area of maize tended to be positioned at lower positions in the canopy. This was, therefore, responsible to bring about an improvement in the light penetration as well as light distribution within the canopy.

(2009) through a modeling approach generalized a maize crop model to explain the trends of changes in the architecture of root and canopy architecture on the yield trends of maize in the US Corn Belt. They introduced a layered, diurnal canopy photosynthesis model for predicting the consequences of variations in the architecture of maize canopy and a two-dimensional root exploration model for predicting the changes and consequences of the variations in the architecture of root system and evaluated them in field experiments in base hybrid of maize, Pioneer 3394. Analysis of simulation studies and field studies of these changes in canopy architecture and RSA in a range of sites, soils and densities has shown that any slight variation that occurred in the architecture of the root system in the capturing of water from the soil had a direct effect on the accumulation of maize biomass and yield. However, the change in the canopy architecture exhibited a minor direct effect on the biomass accumulation and yield trends, though its effects are indirect. These indirect effects are seen in the retention of leaf area and the assimilate partitioning to the development of the maize ear. Postma et al. (2014) used the SimRoot plant model to simulate a threedimensional development of maize root architecture with lateral root branching densities and quantified the uptake rates of nitrate and phos phorus and plant carbon balances in soils which exhibited variations in the availability of these nutrients. The observed phenotypic variation in the lateral root branching density of maize is large, that is, 1-41 cm -1 of the major axis at specific environments. The results revealed that nitrogen acquisition was favored largely by the sparsely spaced LR (less than 7 branches cm -1 ), long laterals were optimal for nitrate acquisition. Similarly, densely spaced (more than 9 branches cm -1 ), short laterals were optimal for phosphorus acquisition. As there exists, a strong competition for nitrate between the LR, it would result in an increase in the branching density of LR and to a decline in the uptake of nitrate per unit root length. The carbon budgets of the plant did not permit larger root length (i.e., individual roots in the high-lateral root branching density plants were shorter). The competition coupled with the limitation of the carbon toward the growth had less influence on the uptake of phosphorus, though there was an increase in the lateral root branching density and larger root length and nutrient uptake. Thus, the results have concluded that in maize, the optimal rate of lateral root branching density is more dependent on the virtual availability of nitrate (a mobile soil resource) and phosphorus (an immobile soil resource) and is larger in those environments which have higher rates of carbon fixation.",

Based on the idea that soil resource acquirement can be enhanced by the concurrence of root foraging and resource availability in time and space a maize hypothetical ideotype is presented. The characteristics specific to ideotype that affect the rooting depth in maize comprise (a) PR with large diameter, long LR and tolerance to low soil temperatures, (b) several seminal roots with small diameter, shallow growth angles, several LR, and long root hairs, (c) many CR with steep growth angles, and only some long laterals, (d) one whorl of BR with shallow growth angle and few long laterals, (e) abundant cortical aerenchyma, large cortical cell size, an optimum number of cells per cortical creating low cortical respiratory burden and faster cortical senescence, (f) unresponsiveness of lateral branching to local resource availability, and (g) low K m and high V max for the uptake of nitrate. Only a few characters of this ideotype have experimental support, others are assumed. Most of these characters of ideotype are pertinent to other cereal root systems and mostly to root systems of dicot crops. Further, owing to the significance of deep rooting for water uptake, this ideotype is pertinent to low-input systems (Lynch, 2013).",

The elucidation of important growth processes provides opportunities to develop maize lines tolerant to drought by identifying important phenotypic characters, ideotypes, and donors. Here, a set of tropical and subtropical maize inbredlines and single cross hybrids were tested at their reproductive stage under water deficit and well-watered conditions. The patterns of biomass production, senescence, and plant water status were observed all over the crop growth period. Under wellwatered conditions, the stay-green pattern was crucial for hybrid yield, whereas the capability to uphold a high biomass all over the growth period was important for inbred yield. Under water deficit conditions, early biomass production before anthesis was essential for inbred yield, whereas delayed senescence was significant for hybrid yield. Further, the growth and senescence patterns were characterized using a new quantitative phenotyping tool, spectral reflectance (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), and the qualitative measurements of canopy senescence were found to be related to grain yield (Cairns et al., 2012).",

In Rwanda, bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) and maize (Zea mays L.) intercrop is most commonly followed mixed cropping system. It was found that farmers consider diverse characteristics for different cropping systems. Farmers evaluate the intercrops based on five aspects: general characters and trait-based competitive ability, inherent competitive ability, adaptation to environment, and management. Farmers deliberate intrinsic competitive ability as an important factor while most other studies have neglected this characteristic in intercrop-breeding methods. Therefore, empowering farmers through on-farm testing of different genotypes would be a feasible solution to costly genotype evaluation by environment trials. This would help to identify highly adaptive and productive genotypes for diverse and resilient cropping systems (Isaacs et al., 2016). Mi et al. (2016) proposed and described in detail two models of RSA for maize ideotype both at the seedling stage and also the adult stage. The root system of maize supports the growth of shoot, for nutrient and water uptake. In intensive planting systems, the maize population density is very high, wherein the nutrients are supplemented externally through intensive fertilizers to meet the requirements of maize plant growth and grain yields. Earlier researches have proposed ideotype characteristics of RSA for water and nutrient uptake and water deficit conditions. They have proposed this ideotype for high-intensity cropping systems for efficient resource utili zation and efficiency. They mentioned that the RSA while proposing an ideotype should be able to meet the efficient usage of water and erratically distributed nutrients in the soil; concomitantly it should also possess larger root resistance for lodging. Additionally, it must be able to adapt for the resourceful use of the nutrients and carbon within the plant. In maize, both the embryonic root system and also the post embryonic root system are under separate genetic mechanisms. These two root systems also vary in their functions at varied soil environmental conditions as well as growth stages. They also described the root characteristic traits of this ideotype of both the axile and LR.",

A total of 102 maize populations were collected from the Italian germplasm and classified based on their grain fatty acid contents. Palmitic acid content was negatively correlated with linoleic acid content. The progressive increase in linoleic acid contents was found to be related with increasing lateness and adaptation to hotter climates. But the morphological characteristics do not show any correlation with the fatty acid contents. So, this new classification method can be applied to improve classifications obtained by the analysis of morphological traits (Camussi et al., 1980). Louette et al. (1997) discussed the significance of models developed to study the in situ conservation of crop genetic resources on the basis of the geographical separation of a community. It was found that the introduction of both improved cultivars and landraces from other communities enhanced the morphophenological diversity of local materials. Alternatively, for defining \"local\" landrace, the geographical direction was shown to be larger than the community itself. Generally, farmers use phenotypic characteristics to differentiate varieties and categorize seeds taken from other farmers in and outside the community. Therefore, it can be concluded that the maize diversity in this community was a result of genetic material introduction and not of geographical isolation. Bellon and Brush (1994) investigated the domestication center of maize viz. Mesoamerica for its biological diversity. It was found that in central Chiapas of Southern México maize farmers cultivate only 15 local varieties belonging to six races and four race mixtures. Though the modern and high yielding varieties of maize were adopted in wide areas, the maize farmer's select only local varieties for specific soils because of agronomic and use standards. As the spatial and temporal separation seems to be insufficient to maintain varieties, farmers maintain them mainly through seed selection. The hybridization between local maize populations can lead to the formation of a heterogeneous population from uniform a population of improved varieties.",

A two-stage classification strategy was used to conduct numerical classification. First, primary groups were made by the Ward method and, then, the modified location model (MLM) refined those groups. This classification was compared with the earliest racial classification by four criteria. The Ward-MLM approach produced more homogeneous groups than those analogous to the earliest racial classification. The numerical classification conserved the structure of the more diverse races but separated the Cateto Sulino race into two more homogeneous groups, each with smaller variance and more diverse than other groups. Groups with clearly distinct features, in terms of the numerical variables, and better, in terms of the four criteria used were produced in numerical classification.

Plants in intercrops grow in a different way from plants in single crops, because of interspecific plant interactions, but adaptive plant morphological responses to competition in mixed stands have not been considered in detail. Here, the maize (Zea mays) response to mixed cultiva tion with wheat (Triticum aestivum) is explained. Findings revealed that early responses of maize to the altered light environment in mixed stands spread throughout maize development, resulting in diverse phenotypes compared with pure stands. They compared photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), red:far-red ratio (R:FR), leaf development, and final organ sizes of maize grown in three cultivation systems: pure maize, an intercrop with a small distance (25 cm) between maize and wheat plants, and an intercop with a large distance (44 cm) between the maize and the wheat. Compared with maize in pure stands, maize in the mixed stands had lower leaf and collar appearance rates, increased blade and sheath lengths at low ranks and smaller sizes at high ranks, increased blade elongation duration, and reduced R: FR and PAR at the plant base during early development. The treatment with a short distance between wheat and maize strips showed greater effects. The results suggested a reaction between leaf initiation and leaf emergence at the plant level and coordination between blade and sheath growth at the phytomer level. A theoretical model, based on coordination rules, was projected to elucidate the development of the maize plant in pure and mixed stands (Zhu et al., 2014). Blackman and Davies (1985) considered the effects of soil drying on maize root and shoot systems. The maize seedlings were grown by dividing their roots between two containers, such that the root part in one container was supplied with water, while the root part in the other container was exposed to reduced soil water potential. The plants in half watered container showed partial closure of stomata; however, leaf water potential, turgor, and abscisic acid (ABA) content remained unaffected. When the leaves from these half watered plants were detached and incu bated under conditions favorable for stomatal opening, the plants still exhibited limited stomatal apertures. Afterward, the closure of stomata accelerated by soil drying was reversed by incubating the plants in kinetin (10 mmol m -3 ) or zeatin (100 mmol m -3 ). These findings suggested that a constant supply of cytokinin from roots may be required to support maximum stomata opening, and stoppage of this supply due to soil drying indicates the inhibition of root activity, leading to restricted stomatal opening and thus limited usage of water.",

Analyses of these candidate genes implicated in hormone transport, cell division and cell size prove correlations between SAM morphology and trait-associated SNP alleles.

Here, the nature of photoreceptor(s) facilitating this anthocyanin formation was analyzed in maize hybrid, Kanchan-521.The anthocyanin pigment formation was seen in all the vegetative organs of maize seedlings exposed to sunlight. After exposing the seedlings to sunlight the slow increase in photoinduction of anthocyanin was observed between 4-16 h and a rapid increment was noted between 16-24 h. They found that the UV-B component of sunlight primarily mediates photoinduction of anthocyanin, which can be elicited by exposing the seedlings to an artificial UV-B light source. When the sunlight exposure was stopped with a far-red pulse before transferring the seedlings to darkness, a decrease in the sunlight-regulated induction of anthocyanin was observed. This indicates a coaction of phytochrome in this photoresponse.

Though apomixis is regulated genetically, its essential genetic components have not been determined to date. Here, the sexual development in maize was compared to the apomixis in maize-Tripsacum hybrids with the help of profiling experiments. In ovules of apomictic plants, six specifically downregulated loci were identified. Out of six loci, four loci were homologous with the members of the RNA-directed DNA methylation pathway, which causes silencing through DNA methylation in Arabidopsis thaliana. Then, two maize DNA methyltransferase genes from the subset, dmt102 and dmt103, were analyzed for their loss-of-function alleles. These genes were downregulated in the ovules of apomictic plants and were homologous to the CHROMOMETHYLASEs and DOMAINS REARRANGED METHYLTRANSFERASE families of Arabidopsis. The analysis unveiled the formation of unreduced gametes and multiple embryo sacs in the ovule. The expression of dmt102 and dmt103 genes was observed in a restricted domain and around the germ cells in the ovule. This suggested that an active DNA methylation pathway during reproduction is vital for the gametophyte development in maize and may perform a significant role in differentiating apomictic and sexual reproduction (Garcia-Aguilar et al., 2010).",

Comparatively, a good performance was exhibited by three inbred lines L6-Y, L24-Y and Sweety 015 across environments and could be potential genotypes in breeding maize for tolerance to both drought and heat stress.

In these climatic conditions, the low temperatures affect the maize yields as they result in the prolongation of duration of the growth period. They not only bring about a decline in the crop growth rates but also enhance the danger of frost resulting in the termination of the premature grain filling. Wilson et al. (1995) assessed the performance of a radiation-and temperature-driven maize simulation model under these climatic conditions. They had modified this model so as to assess the impacts of both temperature and solar radiation on both the maize growth and its yield, simulated under warm as well as cool climate. For improving the simulation of the model in cool climates, certain modifications were made to the simulation model. These included an altered phenology response, a decrease in radiation-use efficiency and an increase in the rate of harvest index and also a bigger time interval between silking and the initiation of grain growth during the low temperatures. This altered model was effective in being in better agreement both with the experimental independent datasets and simulated values of grain and total biomass yield in the locations of all the tropical, subtropical, and cool-temperate regions. The functionality of the model has been improved for a wider range of climates as it exhibited only 12% of the rooted mean deviations. Thus, their findings have indicated that in maize, a greater potential in yields is achievable in regions of warm climates when there is a combination of high incident radiation, low temperature, and long growth duration. These combinations might prove effective only when during the growth of maize the mean temperatures are less than 18°C but such situations are seen only in locations having cool-temperate climates.",

Leaf blade thickness, epidermal and bundle sheath cell size, vascular area, interveinal distance, mesophyll area: bundle sheath area ratio-differed in a complex manner.

TP2 in other leaves led to the production of intermediate (juvenile/ adult) forms with these characters. Tp2 did not have much effect on other traits. In maize, it was observed that the heteroblastic variation in the internal anatomy is mostly under the regulation of some factors which were not related to the developmental phenomenon of phase change. The Tp2 on leaf anatomy is important as it provides information about the developmental processes and their nature of development in bringing about shoot maturation.

When there was only the removal of uppermost and next subsequent leaf, there was an increased duration of canopy apparent photosynthesis and leaf area index (LAI), higher total dry-matter weight at physiological maturity, and even a larger harvest index value. The canopy photosynthesis duration exhibited a subsequent decline with excessive leaf removal of uppermost four and six leaves. Additionally, it was found that a modification in the number of leaves above the ear leaf resulted in varied patterns of allocation of 13 C photosynthates. The photosynthates were distributed to grains with excision of the top two leaves which promoted equal distribution of photosynthates to grains. However, excessive excision of leaves altered the distribution of photosynthates to grains and these were largely retained in the stem and ear bracts. Thus, those plants with only the top two leaves excised had a yield advantage at high plant density due to higher kernel weight and more harvested ears. However, the removal of four or six leaves at the very early grain-filling period (GFP), when kernel sink capacity is in the stage of establishment, resulted in a marked decline in corn yields, due to a reduction in kernel number per plant as well as kernel weight, even though there was the availability of biomass. The results have concluded that excision of two leaves in maize cultivars grown at high plant densities, delay the leaf senescence rate, and bring about an enhancement in the canopy photosynthesis and dry-matter accumulation. This would result in a larger postsilking source-sink ratio that exhibits its positive effect on the kernel weight and subsequent maize yields.",

They observed the maize exhibited little response to the N application toward the leaf area development rather than sorghum. It had a maximum LAI of 3.8, while that of sorghum was 7.4. The differences in these leaf area developments were observed mainly because of more plant density in sorghum compared to maize. Apart from this, the vegetative develop ment period in sorghum was much longer than that of maize.

It is the small quantities of leaf nitrogen that is required to bring about a leaf expansion in the unit leaf area. The research results revealed that if the maize plants were able to maintain the specific leaf nitrogen above 1.0 g m -2 by its uptake and its allocation to leaf, then the leaf expansion rate may proceed to take place at much faster potential rates. Further, it was found that the application of nitrogen reduced the leaf senescence rate during the vegetative period. However, low rates of N application resulted in increased leaf senescence rate at the time of grain filling in the sorghum crop compared to maize. Further, it was observed that maize maintained its specific leaf nitrogen content throughout its life cycle and exhibited a decline during the grain-filling stage.

Two trials, integrated agronomic practices management (IAPM) and nitrogen rate testing (NAT) were undertaken to ascertain the effects on the summer maize root system in the course of five years in North China. IAPM comprised of four treatments (CK: local conventional cultivation practices, Opt-1: an optimized combination of cropping system and fertilizer treatment, HY: treatment based on high-yield studies, and Opt-2: a further optimized combination of cropping system and fertilizer treatment).

Root and seedling displacements in soil adjacent to a transparent Perspex interface were analyzed by means of time-lapse imaging. Wild-type roots had five times greater (2.5 N cf. 0.5 N) peak anchorage forces than hairless mutants in 1.2 g cm -3 soil. Root hair anchorage allowed better soil penetration for 1.0 or 1.2 g cm -3 soil, but there was no significant advantage of root hairs in the densest soil (1.5 g cm -3 ). The anchorage force was not sufficient to allow root penetration of the denser soil, may be because of less root hair penetration into pore walls and, subsequently, poorer adhesion between the root hairs and the pore walls. Hairless seedlings took 33 h to anchor themselves compared with 16 h for wild-type roots in 1.2 g cm -3 soil. Caryopses were frequently pushed several millimeters out of the soil before the roots became anchored and hairless roots often never became anchored securely. The physical role of root hairs in fixing the root tip may be signifi cant in loose seedbeds above more compact soil layers and may also aid root tips to emerge from biopores and penetrate the bulk soil (Bengough et al., 2016).",

In these species, adaptation to the local environments is mostly under the control of complex trait, namely, flowering time. This variation in the flowering time in maize was dissected by using 5000 recombinant inbred lines by Buckler et al. (2009). They used the maize nested association mapping population (NAM). They have assayed this variation in flowering time in approximately a million plants belonging to eight varied environments. They could not trace out any evidence of the existence of a single large-effect quantitative trait loci (QTLs). As a substitute, they evidenced and identified abundant small-effect QTLs, which were shared among the maize families. Further, they found that there was variation in the allelic effects transversely in the founder lines. They did not identify any individual QTLs, with allelic effect that was regulated by geographic origin or that with huge effects for environmental interactions or epistasis. Therefore, they mentioned that in maize flowering time can accurately be predicted by a simple additive model.  Steinhoff et al. (2012) evaluated the genetic architecture of flowering time in an elite maize population of 684 progenies of five linked families, through joint analysis. Nine key QTLs which could explain about 50% of the genotypic variation of the flowering time trait were identified. The phenotypic disparities were much larger compared to the QTL effects on flowering time. These variations existed among the families to a large extent. Further, in a complete two-dimensional genome scan, though they did not detect any epistasis with a genetic background, four digenicepistatic interactions were detected. Thus, their research findings have suggested that in elite maize populations, the flowering time is largely regulated by main effect QTL with pretty small effects; however, epistasis may also put into the genetic architecture of the flowering time trait. Durand et al. (2012) in their earlier studies have found a candidate fragment length polymorphism which was seen to be in close association with the variation in flowering time in a maize inbred line F252. This fragment was detected after continuous selection of trait flowering time for a period of 7 generations in this inbred line. After its identification, in this present study, they have characterized the candidate region. The underlying polymorphisms of this candidate fragment length were identified. They have combined QTL mapping, association mapping, and developmental characterization, to dissect those genetic mechanisms which were associated with the phenotypic variation. It was found that this region in the candidate fragment had a eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF-4A). This initiation factor exposed an elevated level of sequence and structural variation beyond the 3′-UTR of eIF-4A. It included many insertions of abridged transposable elements. By the usage of a biallelic single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (C/T) in the candidate region, they have established its relationship with variation in flowering time in a group of 317 inbred lines of maize. On the contrary, it was found that within the F252 genetic background the T allele was found to be associated with the late flowering time, while it was found to be associated with the early flowering time in this association panel of 317 inbred lines of maize. Three were pervasive interactions between allelic variation and the genetic background. It has pointed out the underlying epistasis. In addition, many pleiotropic effects of the candidate polymorphism were also detected on many characters, namely, flowering time, plant height, and leaf number. They broke down the relationship that existed between the flowering time and the leaf number in the progeny of a heterozygote (C/T) within the F252 background consistent with causal loci in linkage disequilibrium. Thus, they proposed that the phenotypic variation for flowering time in maize is mainly contributed by a cluster of tightly linked genes as well as epistasis.",

Out of these, a total of 90 flowering regions that were recognized one-third of these regions were related to the traits linked to the environmental sensi tivity of the flowering time of maize. Thus, they detected 1000 flowering time associated SNPs, which were found to be distributed roughly around 220 candidate genes in the genome. These SNPs were found to be present within a distance of 1 Mb in these 220 candidate genes. Fascinatingly, they found that only two types of regions were considerably enriched for these related SNPs. Out of the two types of regions; one region was the region of candidate gene, while the other was a 5-kb region found at a distance away from that of the candidate gene. Thus, they mentioned that the flowering time was accurately predictable as most of these SNPs that were associated with the flowering time are highly accurate in nature. Salvi et al. (2007) through the approach of positional cloning and association mapping, they found that the key flowering time quantitative trait locus, Vegetative to generative transition 1 (Vgt1) in maize is a ≈2-kb noncoding region, which was found to be positioned 70 kb upstream of an Ap2-like transcription factor, found to be involved in the regulation of flowering time in maize. They suggested that this Vgt1 functions as a cis-acting regulatory element. This is identified by the correlation of the Vgt1 alleles with the transcript expression levels of the downstream gene. Furthermore, they found that there are evolutionarily conserved noncoding sequences across the maize-sorghum-rice lineages within the region of Vgt1. Their findings have supported the hypotheses that variations that arise in the distant cis-acting regulatory regions are the main components for variations in plant genetic adaptation that arose during the evolution and breeding process.

In the lowland deserts, agriculture became established at a quick pace compared to those highlands in the temperate regions. There was a delay in the establishment of maize in agriculture in these lands for about 2000 years. Though there was a delay in the establishment of maize in temperate high lands, the temperate maize was characterized with the trait of early flowering which enabled them in faster adaptation to these regions. Swarts et al. (2017) tested this characteristic trait of early flow ering of that of modern temperate maize, to identify whether the earliest upland maize was also adapted for this trait. To find the early flowering trait in the earliest maize they have sequenced 15 maize cobs which were 1900-year-old. These maize cobs were obtained from Turkey Pen Shelter in the regions of the temperate Southwest. Some genomic models have predicted that Turkey Pen maize exhibited marginal adaptation to these lands because of early flowering. They have validated these genomic models indirectly and found that Turkey Pen maize not only possessed early flowering, it was also short statured with the ability to produce tillers and exhibited high segregations for the trait of yellow-colored kernels. Thus, their findings have indicated that the differentiation found among the modern maize populations was driven by the adaptations that occurred in the temperate maize. These adaptations of temperate maize were selected in situ from ancient maize standing variations. Further, they have validated that if the polygenic traits are predicted, understanding of ancient phenotypes and their dynamics of adaptations to environments can be improved to a large extent.",

From its center of origin, maize had a pre-Columbian spread and expanded over to the higher latitudes of America. Adaptation of maize to these regions with long-day lengths requires a post domestication selection. Several research findings have shown that there was a delay in the flowering time under long day lengths in both the tropical maize as well as in teosinte. However, it is noticed that the maize adapted to the temperate latitudes has evolved a condensed sensitivity to the length of the photoperiod. Flowering time in maize is regulated by many genes and is a complex trait influenced both by the environment and the genes. Hung et al. (2012) measured the flowering time of maize lines of nested associations and those of diverse association mapping panels under field conditions in both the photoperiods of short day length and long day lengths. They also measured the flowering time in a maize-teosinte mapping population under long day lengths. A component of flowering time in exhibiting a response toward the day lengths of photoperiod for flowering is the photoperiod response. This response involves a subset of flowering-time genes. The effects of these flowering time genes are mostly under the influence of the duration of the day length. Through the mapping of genome-wide association and targeted high-resolution linkage, they have detected a gene ZmCCT. This was found to be a homologue of the rice photoperiod response regulator Ghd7. This was found to be the key vital gene that was affecting the response of maize to flowering in accordance to the photoperiods. Their research findings have shown that in photoperiods of long day lengths, the alleles of ZmCCT obtained from varied teosintes are constantly expressed at elevated levels. The expression of these alleles conferred late flowering time than that of the alleles of maize of temperate regions. They found that most of the inbred lines of maize, even those which have been adapted to the photoperiods of the tropics, carry ZmCCT alleles that exhibit any sensitivity to day length. Thus, the indigenous farmers of the Americas were extremely successful at selecting this genetic variation of the key genes influencing the photoperiod responses and were able to develop maize varieties that have wider adaptabilities to varied environments.",

The reason behind the lag in tapping and utilization of genetic variation of these landraces is due to the presence of genetic linkages that exist between a few of the alleles that are useful and those alleles which are in large numbers and particularly are undesirable for yield improvements. Romero Navarro et al. ( 2017) have integrated the approaches of useful alleles and undesirable alleles and their genetic linkages and characterized the genetic diversity that existed among the 4471 landraces of maize. One thousand four hundred and ninety eight genes were identified which were found to control the latitudinal and longitudinal adaptations of these landraces. Physiological Basis of Crop Growth and Productivity Mapping of the genomic regions of these landraces adapted to regions of varied latitudes and longitudes led to the detection of these genes. In addition, to map the genes controlling the flowering time in maize across environments ( 22) usage of F-one association mapping has led to the identification of 1005 genes. Their results revealed that in totality, 61.4% of the SNPs that were found to be linked with altitude were also connected with the flowering time. Further, it was found that most of these SNPs linked to the altitude were found to be within the large structural variants in the centromeres, pericentromeric regions, and in inversions. Thus, their results of combined mapping have indicated that in maize much of the field variation in these landraces is mostly contributed due to the floral regulatory network of genes.

They evaluated thirty inbred lines of maize to compare the time of the floral transition in these lines. The analysis of their study revealed a 3-week delay in the flowering transition in the tropical maize inbred lines compared to those inbred lines of European flint adapted to the climatic zones of temperate regions under the conditions of long days. Among these thirty inbred maize lines, four lines were found to exhibit large variations in the flowering transition. Thus, an analysis of leaf transcriptomes in these four inbred lines has shown that the flowering time trait in maize is a complex trait regulated by genes. They found that during the transition of meristem in these maize lines, the genes that are encoding the MADS box act as transcriptional regulators which are up regulated in the leaves. They demonstrated that ZmMADS1 represented the functional ortholog of the central flowering time integrator of Arabidopsis (SOC1). In addition, it was found that there was a delay in the flowering time in maize by RNA interference-mediated downregulation of ZmMADS1. On the contrary, a well-built overexpression of ZmMADS1 resulted in an early flowering phenotype of maize. Thus, their results indicated that ZmMADS1 has a key role in acting as a flowering time activator in maize. Thus, they reported that ZmMADS1 in maize is a positive representative of flowering time regulator in maize and does share an evolutionarily conserved function of SOC1 in Arabidopsis.",

Though it had its origin in the tropical southwestern regions of Mexico, it spread over in its cultivation over large regions of latitudinal cline in the regions of the Americas. To unveil the mystery behind the widespread latitudinal spread of maize and its adaptation, Huang et al. (2018) conducted their research studies on positional cloning and association mapping. Through these studies, they determined a flowering time quantitative trait locus similar to the Harbinger-like transposable element. This quantitative trait locus of flowering time was found to be positioned 57 kb upstream of a CCT (CONSTANS, CO-like, and TOC1) transcription factor (ZmCCT9). They found that these quantitative trait loci as Harbinger-like element acts in cis to repress ZmCCT9 expression. It promoted flowering in maize lines during the conditions of long days. To further confirm its function, they had knocked out of ZmCCT9 by CRISPR/Cas9. This caused early flowering in maize lines under conditions of long days. Additionally, they observed that this ZmCCT9 is under diurnal regulation and was found to negatively regulate the expression of the florigen ZCN8. This negative regulation of florigen ZCN8 resulted in late flowering in these lines in long days. Further, the population genetics analyses has identified that Harbinger-like transposon insertion at ZmCCT9 and the CACTA-like transposon insertion at another CCT paralog, ZmCCT10 have arisen sequentially following domestication. These two acted as targets of selection for adaptation of maize to higher latitudes. Thus, their research findings have indicated the complexity of the maize genome and its transposan activity in enabling its spread all across the latitudes.",

Guo et al. (2018) has conducted a study and suggested that the ZEA CENTRORADIALIS 8 (ZCN8) gene which was identified as a key florigen gene of maize playing an important role in the mediation of flowering has a most important QTL q(DTA8). This locus that is specific for flowering time was detected constantly from numerous maize and teosinte populations analyzed. Further, from a large number of diverse inbred lines of maize, they identified a SNP (SNP-1245) in the ZCN8 promoter by following the method of association analysis. This SNP-1245 was found to be strongly linked with that of the flowering time in maize inbred lines. Additionally, this was found to be in cosegregation with qDTA8 of maize-teosinte mapping populations. Thus, they have demonstrated that this activator is linked with the differential binding, by the flowering activator ZmMADS1 of maize. During the early domestication of maize, this SNP-1245 acted as the main target for selection and was involved in driving the preexisting allele of early flowering to near fixation in maize during its domestication. Physiological Basis of Crop Growth and Productivity Captivatingly, they have identified an independent association block upstream of SNP-1245. At this independent association block, the early flowering allele which was thought to be originated from Z. mays ssp. mexicana has introgressed into the early flowering haplotype of SNP-1245. This introgression enabled in the adaptation of the maize to northern high latitudes. Thus, their study demonstrated the method of selection of independent cis-regulatory variants at a gene at dissimilar evolutionary times for local adaptation. Their research findings have highlighted that cis-regulatory mechanisms are complex and mechanisms of evolution are also complex in nature. In conclusion, they have also developed and proposed a polygenic map indicating the pre-Columbian expansion of maize throughout America's high latitudes. Thornsberry et al. (2001) used the approach of association analysis and in 92 maize inbred lines, they evaluated the Dwarf8 sequence polymorphisms. Further, by using a Bayesian analysis 4 of 141 simple sequence repeat loci, they estimated the population structure of these inbred lines. Their research findings have shown that a collection of polymorphisms are associated with the flowering time in maize and these polymorphisms are responsible for the variations that exist with reference to flowering time in maize inbreds at different regions. Further, these polymorphisms include a deletion that may change a key important domain present in that of the coding region of the gene. They further identified that there is a large distribution of nonsynonymous polymorphisms, suggesting that Dwarf8 has been a target of selection of the flowering time.",

Reproductive partitioning was about 50% of shoot growth in soybean and sunflower, while it was less than 50% in nonprolific maize. It was further observed that this reproductive partitioning was quite stable at different plant growths of soybean and sunflower, while it varied largely in maize. In maize, there was instability in the reproductive partitioning at plant growth rates about 2 g day -1 . The reproductive partitioning stability was found to be inversely associated with a PGR C threshold for reproductive growth and positively with reproductive plasticity at high PGR C among the cultivars. They further observed that maize is a species which is commonly prone to barrenness, and in this species, if the reproductive partitioning is given consideration, it enables the improvement of seed number. Seed number represented as a function of reproductive growth is explained with hyperbolic models with x-intercepts in maize. Seed set efficiency in terms of seed number per unit of reproductive growth (Ef), increased with declining reproductive growth in maize and sunflower while it was constant in soybean. In maize, the seed set efficiency became extremely inconsistent and uneven when reproductive growth was much closer to the threshold for seed set. However, in maize, it was observed that this threshold was elevated than that of soybean or sunflower. This might be because of the presence of a greater lower combined demand for assimilate that has resulted due to a higher λ and number of concurrently developing sinks.",

Despite these increases in yield and productivity, very little attention has been given to increasing the nutrient concentrations within grains for supple menting the nutrient requirements of humans and animals as well. It is hypothesized that an increase in the retranslocation of nutrients from the vegetative organs to the grains can be effective to increase these  nutrient concentrations in the grains and thus the nutrient use efficiencies in crops. Chen et al. (2016) monitored dynamic changes of macro-and micronutrients in various organs of maize during the stage of grain filling. Additionally, they have also monitored the mobility of various nutrients and their contribution to maize grain nutrient content in a two-year field trial conducted at low (No N supply) and high (180 kg N ha -1 ). It was found that under high nitrogen supply, there was high net remobiliza tion efficiency of the vegetative organs of the nutrients N, P, K, Mn, and Zinc. The net nutrient remobilization efficiencies of these nutrients were 44%, 60%, 13%, 15%, and 25%, respectively. However, it was found that some nutrients like Mg, Ca, Fe, Cu, and B exhibited a higher rate of net accumulation in the vegetative organs as a whole, during the maize grainfilling stage. There were variations in the remobilization of these nutrients from different organs. For example, the remobilization of nutrients of N, P and Zn were from leaves with a corresponding nutrient remobilization efficiencies of 44%, 51%, and 43%, while that from stalks (including leaf sheaths and tassels) accounted for remobilization efficiencies of 48%, 71%, and 43%, respectively). Potassium was found to be remobilized to a large extent (51%) from leaves, while those of Mg, Ca, Fe, Mn, and Cu were largely remobilized from the stalks with a corresponding remo bilization efficiency of 23%, 9%, 10%, 42%, and 28%, respectively. It is further observed that most of these remobilized nutrients; particularly those of Mg, Ca, Fe, Mn, Cu, and Zn were mainly translocated to the husk and cob. These two organs appeared to serve as buffer sinks for these nutrients where they accumulated. Annual climatic variations affected the remobilization of almost all nutrients except that of P, K, and Zn. Low Nitrogen stress resulted in declined remobilization efficiency of P and Zn, with an increase in Cu, while the remobilization efficiency of other nutrients remained unaltered. In the maize grain, the nutrient concentra tions of P, K, Ca, Zn, and B was unchanged, or the nutrient concentrations exhibited a decline, particularly those of N, Mg, Fe, Mn, and Cu. Their research findings have concluded that the grain nutrient concentrations of N, P, K, Mn, and Zn can effectively be enhanced by the view of their increased remobilization rates from the vegetative organs, while those of Mg, Ca, Fe, Cu, and B concentration are difficult as their remobiliza tion from vegetative organs is very less. Enhancement of leaf senescence rates under low nitrogen stress could not bring about an increase in the grain mineral nutrient concentrations. Thus, studies aiming at improving Physiological Basis of Crop Growth and Productivity nutrient concentrations in grains by genetic improvement have to aim at increasing the nutrient remobilization, taking into consideration the organ-specific remobilization patterns of the target nutrients.",

In modern, stay green maize hybrids, it remained unclear, whether the decline in photosynthesis is due to a major contribution from the N component. Leaf nitrogen is remobilized to grains, which acts as a major contributor to grain N. However, this remobilization of N often resulted in lower photosynthetic rates. Mu et al. (2018) analyzed the relationship between remobilization of different N components and P n during the stage of grain filling in maize at low N (no N application) and high N (180 kg N ha -1 ). It was found that the remobilization efficiency of photosynthetic enzymes [phosphoeno/pyruvate carboxylase (PEPC), pyruvate, orthophosphate dikinase (PPDK), and Rubisco) in the leaf was several folds high than those of thylakoid N and other N components. Simi larly, there was increased remobilization efficiency of all the N components of leaf under the low N supply. However, at the stage of grain filling, it was observed that there was a decline in the quantity of all the N components along with a concomitant decline in the photosynthetic rate. The ratio of P n to the N in the PEPc, PPDK, and Rubisco appeared to increase at the grain-filling stage, while a decline in the ratio of P n to chlorophyll and thylakoid-N occurred at this stage. Correlation analysis revealed that the photosynthetic rate was more linked to the amounts of photosynthetic enzymes rather than to chlorophyll and thylakoid N. Thus, their research findings have led to the conclusion that photosynthetic enzymes serve as an N storage reservoir at the early maize grain-filling stage. The degrada tion of the N storage reservoir is much crucial for the declination of the photosynthetic rate during the later stages of grain filling.",

However, it was found that the importance of postsilking nitrogen appeared at later stages of grain filling. It appeared that a large proportion of the postsilking nitrogen uptake was driven by the postsilking dry matter accumulated in the grain and also that of the vegetative organs. Preclusion of pollination during silking stage was found to have a minor effect on N uptake at postsilking stage. This resulted due to the compensatory growth of stems, husk + cob and roots, and leaves also continuously exported N, though there was removal of grain sink. Nitrogen requirement of grains resulted in increased remobilization efficiency of N of the leaf and that of the stem. Thus, the research findings have indicated that N remobilization from leaf is mostly under the control of sink strength rather than leaf per se. Therefore, grain N accumulation can be increased with an enhancement in the post silking N uptake, rather than the N remobilization.",

The heat stress imposed during the early phase of active grain filling had a larger effect on the kernel weight than those imposed at the silking stage or at the immediate beginning of the anthesis stage. These effects on grain filling were evident in the kernels of temperate hybrid rather than in tropical hybrid. It was observed that heat stress that was imposed at the flowering time, resulted in an enhancement of availability of photo-assimilates to each kernel at the time of this effective GFP, with a concomitant increase in the reserves of carbohydrates in the stem at the time of physiological maturity. Heat stress at flowering did not show any effect on either the dynamics of biomass or accumulation of water in kernels. A reverse trend was observed in those plants where the heat stress was imposed during the active GFP. The grain filling was interrupted to a large extent at this stage. Heat stress resulted in the establishment of strong relationships between the accumulated carbohydrate reserves in stems at the time of physiological maturity and the rate of assimilate availability per kernel during this period of effective grain filling. The effects of heat stress on kernel filling and Physiological Basis of Crop Growth and Productivity kernel weight are more evident in the hybrid of temperate genetic back ground, indicating that they are extremely sensitive to heat stress. Wilhelm et al.

However, an overcompensatory decline in kernel growth rate per HU resulted in an average mature kernel dry weight loss of 7% (P = 0.06). Similar proportional reductions were also found for starch, protein, and oil contents of the kernel. There was also a reduction in the kernel density.

APSIM simulating modeling results indicated that across these 10 sites in North China Plain the potential maize yields exhibited a declining trend even under the conditions of optimal supply of water and nitrogen. They mentioned that in these sites during the preflowering 123 Physiological Basis of Crop Growth and Productivity period in maize, there exists the prevalence of high temperatures coupled with declined solar radiation levels. These were the possible causes for declined yield trends. However, they mentioned that in some of these sites even though there were occurrences of high temperatures and reduced radiations the yield trends were maintained as in these sites there was continuous adoptions of new maize varieties, which assisted to maintain these preflowering periods and enabled them to be extended to postflow ering periods. This coupled with an increased planting density, resulted to have a continuous increase in maize yields at these sites. Thus, there were shrinkage in maize yield gaps at all the sites tested except for the Zheng zhou site. They concluded that a future yield break through is required to overcome the yield potential gaps.",

Seasonal variations comprised large variances in photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) values during the formation of maize grains. Considerable variations resulted for inbreds, hybrids, and genotype by season interactions, general combining ability (GCA) and specific combining ability (SCA) effects and their interactions with seasons. These variations were primarily attributed to the variations in the values of PAR among seasons in Hawaii at the stage of grain filling. There were predominant Additive genetic effects for GFRs and GFP. Thus, they suggested that the breeding approaches taking the benefit of additive gene effects, comprising hybrid breeding with evalua tions in multiple Hawaii seasons may be used to alter GFR and GFP.

The results revealed a variation in kernel weight in the inbred lines across the years which exhibited a range from 104 to 317 mg kernel -1 and 96 to 327 mg kernel -1 in 2006 and 2007, respectively. Varied combinations of kernel growth rate (0.14 to 0.44 mg °Cd -1 kernel -1 ) and grain-filling duration (610-1137 °Cd) resulted in the variations of kernel weight, though there was no correlation between the kernel growth rate and the grain-filling duration. A considerable genotypic variation was noticed with the moisture contents in kernels at their physi ological maturity stage. The moisture concentration at this stage was in the range of 280-600 g kg -1 . On assessment of earlier designed framework of prediction of kernel growth on the basis of water accumulation in the kernels, it was found that genotypic variations exist for kernel water accu mulation, so such a generalized framework for prediction kernel growth rate for all is not appropriate for adoption as a standard framework.",

During the grain-filling stage, plants appeared to establish and possess early kernel sink potential. This places them to grow during the late grain-filling stages in a saturating assimilate availability conditions. This implies that in maize, during the early stages of kernel development, limitations of assimilate, or source limitations are very common. Further, it is also evident that among the various maize genotypes, the reproductive efficiency in kernel setting is not a constant trait at diverse plant growth rates during the flowering stage. Gambín et al. (2006) took into consider ation the plant growth rate per kernel during the GFP as a key indicator of the source availability for each kernel. Taking into consideration the plant growth rate per kernel, they tried to analyze in twelve commercial genotypes of maize, whether this plant growth rate at flowering or of the effective GFP are associated with the kernel weight and also whether any genotypic and environmental variations govern the kernel weight. A curvilinear response was found between that of kernel number per plant and plant growth rate at flowering. An increase in the plant growth rate around flowering appeared to bring about an elevated growth rate per kernel (r 2 = 0.86; P < 0.001). At around the flowering stage, considerable variations in kernel weight were found in genotypes and environments, rather than that of the effective GFP. Diverse variations were found among the genotypes in the kernel growth rates and grain-filling durations too (P < 0.001). The kernel growth rate appeared to exhibit its response in genotypes, with the plant growth rate per kernel which existed around flowering. The kernel growth rate did not exhibit any relationship with the plant growth rate per kernel during the effective GFP. Among the geno types, the grain-filling duration was dependent on the ratio of the plant Physiological Basis of Crop Growth and Productivity growth rate per kernel during the stage of effective grain filling to that of the kernel growth rate.

The duration of grain filling is dependent on the relationship that exists between the water content of the kernels and the development of biomass. This relationship determines the timing of kernels reaching their critical moisture content. By the time the kernels attain critical moisture content within them, the accumulation of biomass ceases. Attainment of critical moisture content by the kernels is under the influence of the timing of cessation of kernel net water uptake or a relationship between water loss and biomass accumulation after attainment of the highest water content in the kernels. To assess the underlying mechanisms contributing to the genotypic variations in maize, Gambín et al. (2007) in 13 commercial hybrids studied the relationship that existed between that of kernel water content and volume of development, grown in diverse environments. Though these 13 commercial hybrids of maize, at the physiological maturity stage, did not exhibit any variations in their kernel percent moisture contents, they did vary in the duration of the grain filling. The duration of grain filling in these hybrids ranged from 1117 to 1470°C day. The differences in the duration of grain filling in these hybrids varied, as there were variations among these in the accumulation of thermal time units from the stage of flowering to the stage of attainment of critical percent moisture content in the kernels. These hybrids did not vary in the accumulated thermal time from the stage of silking to the attainment of maximum water content in the kernels. This stage resulted in the same kernel percent moisture content (ca. 540 g kg -1 ). They explained the variations among these hybrids in the durations of grain filling, on the basis of the pattern of percent moisture content decline in the kernels after they have attained the maximum water content within them. It was found that there was a relationship between the percent moisture content decline or water loss and the biomass deposition in the kernels. A greater degree of water loss from the kernels resulted in speedy kernel growth, with a smaller period of grain-filling duration. The kernels attained a maximal volume after they have attained maximum water content within them, a stage nearer to the stage of physiological maturity.",

A lower rate of dry-matter accumulation per unit moisture was noted in two yellow flint popcorn hybrids, which possessed small seeds. Nevertheless, a common relationship in developmental aspects of kernel growth was noted in all the genotypes evaluated, that was associated with the kernel water content and that of percent moisture content under well-watered conditions.

Previous research findings have shown that a competition arises for assimilates among the kernels, only at the later stages of grain filling. Borrás and Otegui (2001) tested this hypothesis in two commercial maize hybrids with variable kernel weights, grown at two plant densities (3 and 9 plants m -2 ), with variable pollination treatments adopted for modification of kernel number per plant. The results revealed that there is an alteration in the kernel number per plant with a variation of the pollination treatment. Though the relationships between kernel weight and kernel number per plant were negative, such a relationship was not found to be established Physiological Basis of Crop Growth and Productivity between years. Regression analysis revealed that kernel weight had its response to the variations in kernel number per plant. There was an increase in kernel weight (0.09-0.28 mg kernel -1 ) per unit reduction in kernel number per plant, which varied according to plant density and genotype. Kernel weight was very much associated with variations in kernel growth rate during the effective GFP (r 2 = 0.84; P < 0.001). It was not linked to the modifications in the duration of grain filling at this stage. A source-sink ratio that was established at the time of postflowering period in each hybrid was related to the kernel weight. Nonetheless, it was also found that there were variations in the transformation capacity of these hybrids to produce biomass required for kernel weight at the postflowering period.

In general, in most crops, the studies that concentrate on improving this dry-matter content, commonly apply this technique in modeling. The slope of the relationship between the amount of dry matter produced and the radiation intercepted is regarded as the radiation use efficiency. This parameter appears to be constant in crop species under nonstress conditions. Kiniry et al. (1989) tested the consistency of this slope within different grain crops. The quantity of aboveground dry biomass produced per unit IPAR in maize was 3.5 g MJ -1 IPAR, while that in sunflower, rice, and wheat were 2.2, 2.2, and 2.8 g MJ -1 IPAR, respec tively. Their study indicated that variabilities observed within species were not related to the variations in incident solar radiation or temperatures. Dupuis and Dumas (1990) investigated the maize reproductive tissues male and female responses to temperature stress. The fertilization capabilities of the stressed spikelets and pollen were tested by the use of in vitro pollination-fertilization. Through the usage of electrophoresis of 35 S-labeled proteins and fluorography, they analyzed the heat-shock proteins (HSPs) synthesis in these reproductive tissues and established an association among the physiological and molecular responses in maize. The investigation revealed a high rate of decline in the fertilization rate of pollinated spikelets on their exposure to a temperature more than 36°C. A separate exposure of pollen and spikelets to temperature stress has shown that the female tissues were more resistant to 4 hours of cold stress (4°C) or heat stress (40°C). There was induction of synthesis characteristic set of HSPs in the female tissues, particularly under the heat shock conditions. In contrast to the above, they noted that sensitivity to heat stress is more in the mature pollen. This sensitivity of mature pollen to heat stress is the key cause for failure of fertilization in maize at high temperatures.

For each agronomic production system, a specific plant density population is responsible for bringing about maximization of the maize yields. An overview of the factors affecting optimum plant population, with the emphasis on the influences of dense stands on ear development was presented by Sangoi (2001). The optimum plant population density of 30,000 to over 90,000 plants ha -1 is dependent on the factors of soil fertility, water availability, maturity, and so on, for attaining maximum economic grain yields in maize. However, the increment in the number of individuals per area beyond the optimal plant density may contribute to a series of consequences. These consequences are highly damaging to the ontogeny of the ear and often may lead to the occurrence of barrenness. It may delay the differentiation of the ear prior to its effect on the differentiation of the tassel. Apart it may also bring about a reduced growth rate in the later-initiated earshoots with only a lesser number of spikelet primordia transforming to functional florets at the flowering time. These functional florets may extrude their silks slowly. It would further result in a reduced number of fertilized spikelets because of the absence of synchronization in the anthesis and silking. Further, a restraint in carbon and nitrogen supply to the ear may bring about the stimulation in the abortion rates of young kernels after fertilization. The maize ability to face high plant populations without exhibiting excessive barrenness has been enhanced with the availability of earlier hybrids, with shorter plant height, lower leaf number, upright leaves, smaller tassels and better synchrony between male and female flowering time. Developed endurance in high stands has permitted maize to intercept and utilize solar radiation more effectively, contributing to the significant increase in grain (Sangoi, 2001).",

Muchow (1989) made a comparative analysis of the productivities of these crops under these environments.

The stability in biomass production was higher in maize and sorghum under water deficit conditions. The research studies have shown that in response to water shortages and deficits, a decline in the biomass of these crops was mostly related to a decline in the radiation use efficiency of these rather than to a decline in the interception of the radiation by the canopy of these crops except when the water stress conditions were enforced during the early vegetative growth. Maize did not exhibit much efficiency in the mobilization of its preanthesis assimilates under water deficit situations.

It is hypothesized that abortion in the ovary of the developing grains arises mostly due to a limitation in the carbon supply. The carbon becomes limited due to a disruption in the carbon supply that arises in the cleavage of sucrose by the invertase enzymes of cell walls in the developing ovaries. Oury et al. (2016) tested this hypothesis against another one which was linked to that of the expansion and growth of ovaries and to the silks also. In silks and ovaries of both the well-watered or moderately droughted plants, they measured the presence of abundance of those transcripts of genes which were either involved in tissue expansion rates or those concerned with the metabolism of sugars. Simultaneously, they also measured the total amount of sugars that are concentrated in these tissues along with the activities of enzymes involved in the key carbon metabolic process. During the time of water deprivation, they measured the photosynthesis and some indicators of sugar export. The results revealed that though the export of sugars is maintained by leaves, a key initial variation of molecular change was noticed in the silks prior to that in the ovaries. These molecular changes that were seen in the silks indicated that there is a variation in the genes which are involved in bringing about the expansive growth of the ovaries and silks than changes in the genes involved in the metabolism of sugars. There were large differences in the amount and concentrations of sugars that accumulated in the ovaries and also in the activities of the enzymes involved in the sugar metabolic pathways. These changes were more evident initially in the apical ovaries rather than the distal ovaries. These apical ovaries aborted at later stages. They suggested that prior to the switching of the ovaries toward abortion there was a drastic change in the concentrations of sugars and the enzyme activities. In most of the European regions, drought scenarios are very common and are characterized by moderate water deficits. Under these conditions, they proposed that these changes that are likely to occur in the carbon metabolism during the flowering period are responsible consequences for the ovary abortion rather than acting as the causes for the commencement of ovary abortion in maize. However, under severe water-deficit conditions, the ovary abortion that results might be a carbon driven one occurring at the later stages in the life cycle of maize. Thus, their research findings have also supported the view that the primary event that is responsible to bring about abortion in the reproductive organs at the end of the silking stage is the effect on the expansive growth of these organs but not an interruption in the carbon metabolism.",

This increase in the anthesis-silking interval has negative effects on maize yields. Song et al.

They identified 619 genes and 126 transcripts. The expression of these under short day conditions was altered to a large extent by drought stress in the leaves of B73 maize. Twenty genes were identified to exhibit their involvement in flowering time, out of the various drought responsive genes. They predicted the functions of these drought responsive genes and the transcripts by the gene ontology enrichment analysis. On the basis of analysis, they identified that the transcript levels of many genes affecting flowering time, namely, PRR37, transcription factor HY5, and CONSTANS, were considerably changed by conditions of drought. The categories analyzed under gene ontogeny which were associated with flowering time comprised the stage of reproduction, flower development, pollen-pistil interaction, and postembryonic development. In addition, they also identified numerous drought-responsive transcripts containing C 2 H 2 zinc finger, three conserved cysteine residues and one histidine residue (CCCH), and NAC [the NAC acronym is derived from three genes that were initially discovered to contain a particular domain (the NAC domain): NAM (for no apical meristem), ATAF1 and -2, and CUC2 (for cup-shaped cotyledon)] domains. These domain transcripts are often involved in transcriptional regulation. Because of their involvement in transcriptional regulation, they also have immense potentiality in altering the gene expression programs involved in bringing about a change in maize flowering time. The research has provided a genome-wide analysis of differentially expressed genes, novel transcripts, and isoform variants which were expressed during the reproductive stage of maize plants when exposed to conditions of short days and drought stress.

However, in this region the research study had indicated that considerable (55%) of the total number of fields had excess water supply in maize production. Similarly, the pivot irrigation and conservation tillage in soybeanmaize rotation fields resulted in more irrigation water-use efficiency as well as the grain yields. However, it was observed that the applied irrigation was 41% and 20% less under pivot and conservation tillage in comparison to that under surface irrigation and conventional tillage. A simulation analysis that has been carried out in the study has revealed that when the irrigation systems are shifted toward the pivot irrigation system, in this region, there could be a saving of 32% of the total yearly water volume owed to irrigated maize. Even though there might occur a little of yield decline, this could be effectively overcome with the adoption of improved synchronous irrigation schedules of crop water requirements.",

There was a delay in the leaf appearance up to 6 days by water deficit and reduction in plant height and leaf area by 15% and 33%, respectively.

Though many differences were not recognized for these traits in both the Bt and non-Bt maize plants, in the first generation corn borer damage, there were wide variations for these traits for the damage by second generation corn borers. The Bt plants were less affected by the damage of second-generation corn borer damage. Bt plants recorded more plant weight and grain yield (Traore et al., 2000). Cakir (2004) in his three-year study of pioneer corn hybrid 3377 found that water shortages resulted in a decline in the vegetative and yield parameters. The occurrence of water stress at the vegetative and tasselling stages not only brought a decline in the plant height it also led to a drastic decline in the leaf area development. During the rapid vegetative growth period, short-duration water stress resulted in a 28-32% loss of final dry-matter weight. The omission of a single irrigation during one of the sensitive growth stages brought about a 40% loss in the grain yields, particularly during the dry years. A large extent of yield losses of 66-93% may occur if there is a prevalence of water stress prolonged during tasselling and ear formation stages.

In the early first periods of phosphorous deficiency, there was not much reduction in the radiation use efficiency though it exhibited a reduction at the later stage. There was a reduction in the root growth, particularly; the elongation rate and the emergence of the axile roots from the first-order laterals were decreased, though there was no reduction in the density of these laterals by P starvation. These morphological responses have indicated that the availability of carbohydrates limits the formation of the roots and their growth. Their results were consistent with the assumption that P deficiency mainly affects the morphology of the root system by affecting the carbon budget of the plant with no further effect of P deficiency on root morphogenesis. The severe and early reduction of shoot growth after P deficiency may elucidate that more carbohydrates were available for root growth. This may describe the small stimulation of root growth which was detected a few days after P starvation and stated by several authors.

They assessed this hypothesis in sixteen commercial maize varieties improved over the past years, by planting them at two nitrogen levels and three planting densities. The results have indicated that in the most recently developed cultivars, root systems were more or less shallow and possessed one less nodal root per whorl. These cultivars also revealed that the distance from the emergence of nodal root to that of lateral branching was double and additionally had 14% higher metaxylem vessels. However, in these cultivars, the total metaxylem vessel area has remained unaffected. This was mostly due to the prevalence of less area of 12% by every vessel of metaxylem. Plasticity has been observed even in cortical phenes, namely, aerenchyma. The aerenchyma tissue increased in the cultivars at highdensity populations. Simulation modeling with SimRoot has confirmed that even the occurrence of comparatively minor variations in maize root system architecture and its anatomy could bring about an increase in the shoot growth by 16% even at high-density population or in a high nitrogen rich environment.

Yield improvement is the outcome of more effective capture and utilization of resources, and the enhanced efficiency in resource capture and utilization of newer hybrids is often evident under stress. The greater interception of seasonal incident radiation and higher uptake of nutrients and water resulted in improved resource capture. The improved resource capture is related with increased leaf longevity, a more active root system, and a higher ratio of assimilate supply by the leaf canopy (source) and assimilate demand by the grain (sink) during the GFP. Under optimum conditions, resource use improvements have been small because leaf photosynthesis, leaf-angle distribution of the canopy, grain chemical composition, and the proportion of dry matter distributed to the grain at maturity (i.e., harvest index) have remained almost constant. Genetic improvement of maize has been accompanied by a decrease in plant-to-plant variability. This study's findings indicated that improved stress tolerance is related with lower plant-to-plant variability and that increased plant-to-plant variability results in lower stress tolerance.",

This increment in yield can be accredited to a series of technological, cultural, and management practices adopted by farmers. Cardwell (1982) attempted a study of the magnitude of the changes and the relative contributions to grain yield each practice has made over the 50-year time period. The transformation from open-pollinated to hybrid corn combined with the expected 36.5 kg ha -1 year -1 genetic gain has given 58% of the yield increase. Though it has been estimated that each kilogram of applied commercial N increases yields by 18.9 kg grain kg -1 for 47% of the gain in yield, the effects of less manure, and reduced N from mineralized organic matter actually produces a net N effect of 19%. Twenty-three percent of yields have been increased by the use of herbicides on 93% of the hectare to get improved weed control.",

Improved soil drainage, fall plowing, and herbicides allowed planting 10 days earlier for an average gain of 36.4 kg ha -1 day -1 and a total of 8% of the net increase. Drilling corn instead of hill dropping has contributed 8% and fall plowing has contributed 5% to current yields. Row spacing has reduced from 107 to 90 cm for a gain of 10.2 kg ha -1 cm or 4% of the gain. Rotation changes had no net effect on N balance with increases in soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] offsetting decreases in forage legume hectarage. However, there has been a negative effect of more hectares of corn following corn resulting in 3% loss from corn rootworm (Diabrotica spp.) and 7% loss due to the interfer ence effect of corn following corn. Corn borer (Ostrinia nubilalis Hubner) became a problem in the 1940s and has reduced yield potential an average of 5%. Soil erosion has reduced yield potentials by 8% over the 50 years. Other negative and unaccounted factors reduce the potential yields by 23%. Maize yields increased continuously in places where hybrid maize has been adopted, starting in the US Corn Belt in the early 1930s. The combined effect of plant breeding and improved management practices produced this gain. Fifty percent of the increase on an average may be due to manage ment and the rest to breeding. These two tools interact so strongly that neither of them could have produced such advancement alone. However, Physiological Basis of Crop Growth and Productivity genetic gains may have to endure a larger share of the load in future years. Hybrid traits have undergone changes over the years. Trait variations that increased resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses (e.g., drought tolerance) are many but morphological and physiological variations that raise effi ciency in growth, development, and partitioning (e.g., smaller tassels) were also recorded. Some characters have not changed over the years because breeders have intended to hold them constant (e.g., grain maturity date in US Corn Belt). In some situations, they have not changed, in spite of breeders' intention to change them (e.g., harvest index). Though breeders have constantly selected for high yield, at the same time the requirement to select for overall reliability has been a driving force in the selection of hybrids with higher stress tolerance over the years. New hybrids yield more than their predecessors in unfavorable as well as favorable growing conditions. Enhancement in the capability of the maize plant to overwhelm both large and small stress bottlenecks, instead of improvement in primary productivity has been the key driving force of improved yielding ability of new hybrids (Duvick, 2005). Cerrato and Blackmer (1990) mentioned that decisions regarding optimum rates of fertilization directly or indirectly include fitting some type of model to yield data gathered when several rates of fertilizer are applied. Though many models are utilized in describing crop yield response to fertilizers, it is rarely elucidated why one model is chosen over others. They compared and evaluated several models (linear-plus-plateau, quadratic-plus-plateau, quadratic, exponential, and square root) normally used for describing the response of corn (Z. mays L.) to N fertilizer for 12 site-years of data, each having 10 rates of N applied preplanting. AH models fit the data equally well when evaluated by using the R 2 statistic. All models showed comparable maximum yields, but there were striking differences among models when predicting economic optimum rates of fertilization. Mean (across all siteyears) economic optimum rates of fertilization as shown by the various models ranged from 128 to 379 kg N ha -1 at a common fertilizer-to-corn price ratio. Statistical analyses specified that the most commonly used model, the quadratic model, did not give an acceptable explanation of the yield responses and have a tendency to show optimal rates of fertilization that were too high. The yield responses recorded in the study were best described by the quadratic-plus-plateau model. The findings showed that, particularly amid increasing concerns about the economic and environmental effects of overfertilization, the reason for selecting one model over others deserves more attention thus it has got in the past. Stuber et al. (1987) mentioned that characters such as grain yield are polygenetically inherited and strongly affected by environment, determination of genotypic values from phenotypic expression is not accurate and improvement strategies are often based on low heritabilities. These traits can be improved with the increased knowledge of the genetic factors involved in the expression of yield. Here, the QTLs linked with grain yield and 24 yieldassociated traits were identified in two F 2 populations of maize (Z. mays L.) using isozyme marker loci. Further, the types and magnitudes of gene effects expressed by these QTLs were assessed. About two-thirds of the associations among 17-20 marker loci and the 25 quantitative traits were significant with a large proportion of these at P < 0.001.",

Though both the genetic and agronomic-management improvements have contributed to increase the grain yield, Tollenaar and Lee (2002) stated that the genotype × management interaction resulted in most of this improvement. The genetic improvement in maize yield is not associated with yield potential per se or with heterosis per se, but it is associated with improved stress tolerance, which is constant with the improvement in the genotype × management interaction. The prospective for future yield improvement through improved stress tolerance of maize in the Physiological Basis of Crop Growth and Productivity United States is large, as yield potential is about three times greater than present commercial maize yields. The mechanism used by maize breeders to improve stress tolerance is not known, but they speculated that improved stress tolerance may have resulted from the selection for yield stability. Stability analyses were applied on a number of high-yielding maize hybrids, comprising three hybrids that have been involved in some of the highest maize yields recorded in producers' fields, and studied the association between yield and yield stability. The stability analyses revealed that high-yielding maize hybrids can vary in yield stability, but findings do not support the belief that yield stability and high grain yield are mutually exclusive.",

The utilization of CIM permitted the assessment of QTL-by-environment interactions (Q × E) and therefore could find \"stable\" QTLs across drought environments. Two such QTLs for GY, on chromosomes 1 and 10, coincided with two stable QTLs for KNO. Additionally, four genomic regions were found for both GY and the anthesis-silking interval (ASI) expression. In three of these, the allelic contributions were for short ASI and GY increase, while for that on chromosome 10 the allelic contribution for short ASI corresponded to a reduction in yield. The study findings revealed that to increase yield under drought, marker-assisted selection (MAS) by means of only the QTLs involved in the expression of yield components seems not to be the best approach, and neither does MAS using only QTLs involved in the expression of ASI. Therefore, they favor a MAS strategy that considers a combination of the \"best QTLs\" for various characteristics. The QTLs stable across target environments denote the largest percentage possible of the phenotypic variance, and though not influence the expression of yield directly, should be involved in the expression of characteristics strongly associated with yield, such as ASI (Ribaut et al., 1997).",

The effects of drought on yield reductions are more severe under situations where the drought stress prevails particularly at the flowering period. In Mexico, 85 full-sib progenies of the tropical lowland population Tuxpeno cultivated on 3 soil moisture-deficit treatments have revealed that there was considerable genotype (progeny) × soil moisture-deficit interaction for GY. Under the severe moisture deficit, yield showed a positive association with the rate of leaf and stem extension, the interval between male and female flowering and the rate of foliar senescence. These indices were utilized with GY in a selection index. To test its usefulness, experimental varieties obtained from progenies selected for yield per se under the different soil moisture-deficit treatments and a divergence (index-tolerant and indexsusceptible) of performance using the selection index were cultivated under conditions similar to those of the early progeny evaluation. The maize germplasm was screened for drought tolerance (Fig. 7.1) and the drought-tolerant variety (selected for yield and favorable adaptive traits) out yielded all others by 500 kg ha -1 under the severe moisture-deficit but not at the loss of yield under the WW conditions. Recurrent selection was practiced for these characters under similar moisture-deficits among 250 full-sib progeny in this population for three cycles. Canopy temperature, determined by infrared thermometry before flowering, was strongly correlated (r = -0.73 ** ) with yield under severe moisture-deficits, and was included in the selection index after the second cycle. After three cycles of improvement with 33% progeny-selection intensity, assessment under the same soil moisture-deficits exhibited that GY increased by 1.8, 7.8, and 21.6%, or 320, 420, and 410 kg ha -1 cycle -1 under the mild, medium, and severe moisture-deficits, respectively. Under WW conditions, significant changes were observed in the drought-adaptive traits, but days-to-flowering did not show any significant change (Fischer et al., 1989). In the United States, there was a steady increase in the maize average yields. Despite the variations in the harvestable yields, there was a large improvement in the yields even under the limitations of drought stress. Yield variability may result from the differences in the environmental stresses, nitrogen inputs, effective weed management practices, etc. The sensitivity of maize yields under water-limiting environments persists due to the prevalence of variations in the input supplies and availability of improved maize lines. Despite the drought stress bringing considerable losses in yields under variable environments, the cultivation of new commercially improved maize hybrids is enabling the production of substantial maize yields every year. Under water-limited situations, several factors contribute to better plant performance. Attempts are being done for improvement of characteristic traits in maize hybrids like better partitioning of biomass to the developing ear, faster spikelet growth, and better reproductive success. An emphasis on the faster growth rate of spikelet may bring about a decrease in the number of spikelets formed on the ear that enables overall seed set by decreasing water and carbon limitations per spikelet. To find the molecular mechanisms for drought tolerance in improved maize lines, many genomic tools are being used. Novel molecular markers and comprehensive gene expression profiling approaches offer prospects to direct the continued breeding of genotypes that gives table GY under different environmental conditions (Wesley et al., 2002).",

Under water-deficit conditions, there was no production of grain in maize, though its production of biomass was more stable rather than other crops. The reduction in biomass under water deficit may be due to its association with a higher reduction in radiation-use efficiency rather than with a reduction in radiation interception, but when the water deficit was imposed during early vegetative growth, the opposite case was observed. Pre-anthesis mobilization of assimilate to grain was noticed in sorghum and millet but not in maize.

Banziger et al. (2002) evaluated the adaptive changes connected to drought tolerance in four tropical maize popula tions grown at variable N supplies in Mexico. These populations were selected for tolerance to the occurrence of mid-season drought stress and these populations produced more number of ears per plant and kernel weight across N levels. In these populations, a close association was found between the numbers of ears per plant, linked to a shorter ASI of drought-tolerant cycles. ASI was reduced to a large extent even under N stress, though it was not found to be connected to either biomass or N accumulation of plants and ears during the flowering period. Though there was no change in the individual kernel N content with selection, a decline in grain N concentrations was observed. Similarly, the kernels with more weights have resulted due to a delay in the rate of leaf senescence and an increase in the supply of assimilated during the active grain filling stage. Thus, their findings have concluded that a declined rate of ear abortion and increased assimilate supply during grain filling of maize selected for tolerance to mid-season drought, also impart tolerance to N stress. It might thus contribute to better yields and yield stability. Manavalan et al. (2011) screened 25 diverse parental lines of maize nested association mapping panel along with the common parental line, B73, for constitutive root traits (including rooting depth and root biomass) and shoot traits conferring adaptation to drought. The findings revealed that these diverse lines had considerable variation for traits of root viz. root length, root biomass, shoot length, and leaf area. The root length on average in these lines was in the range of 17.5-106 cm. It was observed that those genotypes which possessed a deeper root system also possessed a higher biomass and leaf area. Thus, they mentioned that this natural genetic variation that is seen with in these lines could be utilized and exploited in identifying those potential QTLs which are involved in the regulation of root architecture.",

The total root length was positively correlated to the total root surface area and the root forks. Root variation among these lines was to a large extent contributed by the total root length and total root surface area. These two root traits are more suited traits of selection criteria at the seedling stage of maize.

(2014) evaluated these postulates in maize genotypes at WW and water stress conditions at greenhouse mesocosms and in the field in the United States and Malawi. The root cortical cell file number in these genotypes ranged between 6 and 19, with a greater decline under the mesocosms grown genotypes. These genotypes had a decline in rates of root respiration by (57%) per unit of their root length. Additionally, under the water stress conditions these had a deeper rooting (15-60%), larger stomatal conductance (78%), large leaf CO 2 assimilation (32%), and more shoot biomass (52-139%). On the contrary, under similar conditions of water stress, in the field, genotypes with declined cortical cell file number, exhibited deeper rooting (33-40%), lighter stem water oxygen isotope enrichment (δ 18 O) signature (28%). This has indicated that these genotypes were significantly efficient in capturing the water from the deeper soil layers. The relative water content in the leaves of these genotypes was (10 and 35%) larger, with a larger shoot biomass also (35 and 70%) at flowering. The yields were also higher by several folds than those genotypes with many cell files. Thus, their findings have supported the above hypotheses.

Several evidences reveal the vital role of heat shock proteins (HSPs) in improving survival at high temperatures. However, there is a significant variability in the synthesis of these among and within species, it is not known why this variation occurs and to what amount of variation in HSPs among organ isms may be associated with differences in thermotolerance. One option is that HSPs production confers costs and natural selection has worked toward enhancing the cost-to-benefits of HSP synthesis and accumulation. But, still the costs of this production are not determined. If HSP produc tion confers significant nitrogen (N) costs, then Heckathorn et al. (1996) discussed that plants cultivated under low-N conditions may accumulate less HSP than high-N plants. Furthermore, if HSPs were associated with thermotolerance, then the difference in HSPs induced by N (or other factors) may associate with the disparity in thermotolerance. To test these predictions, Heckathorn et al. (1996) cultivated a variety of corn (Zea mays L.) under various N levels and then subjected the plants to serious heat stress. They observed that high-N plants produced more amounts of mitochondrial Hsp60 and chloroplastic Hsp24 per unit protein. In these, the patterns of HSP production were associated with PSII efficiency, which was measured by F v /F m . Therefore, their findings indicated that N availability affects HSP production in higher plants. This in turn suggested that production of HSP might be resource-limited and that among other benefits; chloroplast HSPs (e.g., Hsp24) may have limit damage due to PSII function during heat stress (Heckathorn et al., 1996).

A review of literature and data set of about 140 scientific articles have ascertained the crucial tempera ture thresholds and responses of rice and maize to extreme temperature, complementing a former study on wheat. Lethal temperatures and cardinal temperatures, along with error estimations, have been recognized for phenological phases and development stages. Temperature thresholds of the three crops for the important physiological processes such as initiation of the leaf, shoot growth and root growth, and for the most susceptible phenological phases, for example, sowing to emergence, anthesis, and grain filling were statistically analyzed by following the methodology of earlier work. The study summarized that the cardinal temperatures were conservative between researches and were apparently well described in all three crops. In all the three crops, anthesis and ripening were found to be the most temperature-sensitive stages (Sánchez et al., 2014).",

(1999) determined the effects of a prolonged period of high temperature during grain filling on kernel growth (Fig. 7.3), composition, and starch metabolism of seven maize inbreds which were exposed to heat stress (33.5/25°C) or control (25/20°C) day/night temperature treatments in a greenhouse from 15 d after pollination (DAP) till maturity. They did not observe any considerable interaction that took place between genotype and temperature treatments for nine grain traits. There was a lengthening in the duration of grain filling by heat stress based on heat units. On a heat unit basis, they found that there was a decrease in kernel growth rate per heat unit. Further, there was also a dry weight loss of 7% in the mature kernel. Proportionally alike decreases were observed for starch, protein, and oil contents of the kernel. There was also a reduction in the kernel density. Enzymes extracted from developing endosperm namely ADP glucose pyro phosphorylase, glucokinase, sucrose synthase, and soluble starch synthase appeared to be highly sensitive to heat stress. However, when enzyme activities were adjusted with measured temperature coefficients (i.e., Q 10 ), only ADP glucose pyrophosphorylase showed reduced activity. These findings indicated that chronic heat stress during grain filling moderately inhibits seed storage processes and chooses starch metabolism enzymes to comparable degrees through multiple maize inbreds (Wilhelm et al., 1999).",

Duke and Doehlert (1996) postulated that heat stress may affect gene expression in developing kernels, thus influencing enzyme activities and storage product accumulation. To verify this assumption, maize (Zea mays L. hybrid B73xMo17) kernels were cultured in vitro and grown at 25 (control), 30, and 35°C. At 5-day intervals, developing kernels were examined for levels of gene expression and enzyme activity. Message levels of all genes evaluated viz. Shrunken-1, Shrunken-2, Brittle-2, Aldolase, Waxy, α-Zein, β-Zein, and Opaque-2 were decreased 65-80% after 5 days at 35°C. On the other hand, of the 17 enzymes assayed, only the activities of adenosine diphosphate glucose (ADP-Glc) pyrophosphorylase, aldolase, aspartate aminotransferase, acid invertase, and acid phosphatase were reduced by heat stress. Though the reduction in ADP-Glc pyrophosphorylase activity matched well with its decreased mRNA, aldolase activity roughly corresponded to its mRNA levels, and sucrose synthase activity was not affected by growth temperature, even though its transcript was decreased by 80%. They suggested that the reductions in enzyme activities in the heat-stressed kernels were due to declines in transcript. The different responses of enzyme activities to the heat stress may reflect variances in protein turnover. In the following experiment, they verified the assumption that heat stress may interfere with the ability of a maize kernel to produce pathogenesis response proteins. In cultured kernels grown at 25°C by treating with salicylic acid two-fold increment in the activity of the pathogenesis-related protein, chitinase, was observed. But, the salicylate-induced increment in chitinase activity was inhibited in kernels grown at 35°C. These findings suggested that heat stress prevents the induction of pathogenesis-related proteins in the maize kernel, and may, thus, interfere with the capability of the kernel to defeat pathogen invasion. Lobell et al. (2013) reported that statistical studies of rainfed maize yields in the United States and other regions have showed two clear features: a strong negative yield response to an increase of temperatures above 30 °C (or extreme degree days (EDD)), and a comparatively weak response to seasonal rainfall. They showed that the process-based Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) is capable to reproduce both of these associations in the Midwestern United States. It provided insights into basic mechanisms. The principal effects of EDD in APSIM were associated with increased vapor pressure deficit, which causes water stress in two ways: by raising demand for soil water to maintain a given rate of carbon assimilation, and by decreasing future supply of soil water by increasing transpiration rates. Daily water stress as the ratio of water supply to demand was computed by APSIM and this ratio was found to be three times more responsive to 2°C warming than to a 20% reduction in precipitation during the critical month of July. The findings suggested a comparatively negligible role for direct heat stress on reproductive organs at present temperatures in this region. Effects of raised CO 2 on transpiration efficiency should lessen yield sensitivity to EDD in the next decades, but at most by 25%.",

The heat waves generated from this infrared technology resulted in warming the canopy about 6°C above ambient canopy temperatures. These temperatures were maintained for three consecutive days during vegetative development (Wv1) and during an early reproductive stage (silking; Wv2) (Fig. 7.4). High temperatures given at both stages had no effect on the above ground vegetative biomass, but the heat stress at the silking stage had an effect in declining the reproductive biomass and drying of spikelets of tassel (Fig. 7.4). The high temperature treatment given at the early reproductive stage was found to bring about a reduction by 16% in the total reproductive biomass. This reduction in the reproductive biomass was due to a decline in the cob length as well as cob and husk mass. Though there was a decrease in the seed yield as well as KN, these reductions were not statistically significant. Heat stress resulted in transient reductions in leaf water potentials and midday photosynthesis, though there was no such impact on the soil water status. There was a complete recovery of leaf water potential and midday photosynthesis after the heat stress treatment; the results indicated that reproductive structures are more sensitive to the direct effects of high temperature stress rather than the vegetative structures.",

          "text": "Heat stress occurring during the grain filling stage in maize has an effect on the physicochemical characteristics of the grain. The quality of the grain is affected. In four waxy maize varieties, the effect of heat stress (35.2/16.1 o C with mean day and night temperatures) was imposed during the grain filling stage, that is, 1-40 days after pollination, was evaluated for its effect on the structure and thermal properties of starch accumulated in the grain by Lu et al. (2014). It was found that there was an increase in the granule size of the starch grains, with a proportionate increase in the amylopectin chains than the amylose chains. In addition, heat stress also resulted in the development of pitted starch granules of uneven surfaces. These starch granules had a declined swelling power. Though there was an increase in the gelatinization temperature and retrogradation percentage, there was no effect on the gelatinization enthalpy by heat stress imposed during the grain filling stage. The results thus indicated that heat stress prevailing during the grain filling stage of maize has an effect on the structural characteristics of waxy starch maize. Baszczynski et al. (1982) mentioned that exposure of 5-day-old plumules of corn (Zea mays L.) to raised temperatures for brief periods of time shifts the protein synthesis pattern from the production of a broad spectrum of proteins to the novel and (or) increased synthesis of a small number of heat shock polypeptides (HSPs). Most prominent is the low synthesis of a major polypeptide (relative mass (Mr) = 93,000 and isoelectric point = 8.0) normally made at 27°C and the increased and (or) new synthesis of polypeptides with Mrs of 108,000; 89,000; 84,000; 76,000; 73,000; and 18,000, following 1 h of heat shock. These six HSPs resolve into 18 spots by two-dimensional fluorographic analysis. The induction of the HSPs needs temperatures at or above 35°C for noticeable synthesis. Some of the HSPs are synthesized following only 15 min at 41°C and synthesis of all HSPs is observed within 120 min following heat shock. Recovery from heat shock is fast; after 6 to 8 h at 27°C following heat shock, the polypeptide pattern is identical with the control. Polypeptide synthetic patterns produced from the extracts of individual heat shocked shoots were indistinguishable to those from extracts of 20 shoots, irrespective of whether single shoots were intact or excised during labeling. Polypeptide synthetic patterns and response of single 5-day-old primary roots to heat shock were identical to shoots. This was the first demonstration of the heat shock polypeptides induction in a whole, intact higher plant. Dupuis and Dumas (1990) investigated the response of maize (Zea mays) male and female mature reproductive tissues to temperature stress. The fertilization rate was more declined when pollinated spikelets were subjected to temperatures above 36°C. When pollen and spikelets were subjected to temperature stress separately, the female tissues seem resis tant to 4 h of cold stress (4°C) or heat stress (40°C). Under heat shock conditions, the production of a typical set of HSPs is induced in the female tissues. On the other hand, the mature pollen was sensitive to heat stress and was accountable for the failure of fertilization at high temperatures. Heat shock response was found in the mature pollen at the molecular level. Massonneau et al. (2005) carried out inclusive searches of maize EST data which made possible the identification of 8 new Corn Cystatin (CC) genes besides the earlier known genes CCI and CCII. They found that in all 10 genes the assumed amino acid sequences had typical cystatin family signature. Furthermore, they show a prolonged general similarity with cystatins from other species belonging to a number of diverse phyto cystatin subfamilies. To get an extra understanding of their respective roles in the maize plant, gene-specific expression profiles were created by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Though 7 CC genes were expressed in two or more tissues differing from gene to gene, CCI was preferentially expressed in immature tassels and CC8 and CC10 in developing kernels. The in situ hybridization of maize kernels revealed that CC8 was specifically expressed in the basal region of the endosperm and CC10 both in the starchy endosperm and the scutellum of the embryo. The other non-kernel-specific genes had different expression kinetics during kernel development, normally with peaks during the early stages. Along with developmental regulation, the effect of cold stress and water starvation was verified on cystatin expression. The cold stress induced two genes (CC8 and CC9) and 5 genes (CCII, CC3, CC4, CC5, and CC9) were downregulated in response to water starvation. Altogether this data suggested diverse functions for CC genes in the maize plant.",

They did not observe any size mediated propagation of reduction of an initial growth; however, it was found that a longer duration of leaf elongation was responsible for compensating the declined rates of leaf elongation during their initial or early stages of growth. Cold-induced response at leaf level in maize is contributed by the cell division and cell expansion rates. Thus, their findings have demonstrated that in maize the kinetics of leaf elongation and the attainment of final leaf length are under the control of processes at the n -1 (cell proliferation and expansion) and n + 1 (whorl size signal) scales.

The length of the primary lateral roots showed a negative association with the germination index (r = -0.38). A previous study in hydroponics established a large number of independently inherited loci appropriate for the enhancement of early seedling growth through better seed vigor and/or a higher rate of photosynthesis. Variations in anthocyanin content and transcript abundance for genes whose products function in general phenylpropanoid metabolism and the anthocyanin pathway were examined in maize (Zea mays L.) seedlings during the short-term, low-temperature treatment by Christie et al.

In tested lines capable of producing anthocyanin geno typically, anthocyanin accumulation was noticed.

Within 6 h of cold stress transcripts 4Cl (EC 6.2.1.12) and Chi (EC 5.5.1.6) increased considerably, then further increase was not observed over the next 36 h, and dropped to pretreatment levels upon returning seedlings to 25° C.

A 39-kDa protein was activated by cold stress. The other two proteins, of 35 kDa and 52 kDa, constitutively phosphorylated MBP during senescence and temperature up-shift. Judging from their molecular masses, cation requirements, and substrate speci ficities, it appeared likely that the 39-kDa, 41-kDa, and 45-kDa proteins signified mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). Consequently, two MAPK cDNAs were isolated from a cDNA library constructed using mRNAs from senescent leaves. Northern analysis exhibited that the transcript corresponding to one of the cDNAs, designated ZmMPK5, collected in healthy leaves 3 h after the up-shift to 25° C as well as in senescent leaves, suggesting that the ZmMPK5 encodes 45-kDa protein kinase. Western analysis using an antiserum against the C-terminal region of ZmMPK5 showed that the level of the ZmMPK5 protein increased in senescent leaves. These findings suggested that a 45-kDa MAPK is involved in the senescence process and recovery from low-temperature stress in maize. Zaidi et al.

(2004) make an effort to find the most susceptible/critical crop stage(s) of maize for excess moisture stress. Among the four crop stages, viz. early seedling (V2), knee-high (V7), tasseling (VT) and milk stage (R1), early seedling was found to be highly susceptible, followed by the tasseling stage. A screening technique (cup method) was developed/standardized and was found to be an effectual technique for large-scale screening of maize genotypes against excess soil moisture stress (Fig. 7.5). Germplasm was screened using this technique and then field evaluation was performed at the V7 growth stage (seventh leaf visible). Various growth and biochemical parameters were affected severely with excess soil moisture stress; it impaired anthesis and silking, and finally resulted in poor development of kernel and yield. However, significant variability was observed among the genotypes screened. Geno types with good accumulation of carbohydrate in stem tissues, moderate stomatal conductance, <5 days ASI, high root porosity, and early brace root development ability exhibited high tolerance against the hypoxia/ anoxia caused by excess soil moisture conditions. Saab and Sachs (1996) isolated a flooding-induced maize (Zea mays L.) gene (wusl1005 [gfu]; abbreviated as 1005) encoding a homolog of xyloglucan endo-transglycosylase (XET), a putative cell-wall loosening enzyme active during germination, expansion, and fruit softening. XET and its related enzymes may also be involved in cell-wall metabolism during flooding-induced aerenchyma development. Under flooded conditions, 1005 mRNA accumulates in root and mesocotyl locations and develops aerenchyma, which reaches maximum levels within 12 h of treatment. Development of aerenchyma was noticed in the same locations by 48 h of treatment. In both root and mesocotyl, the treatment with the ethylene synthesis inhibitor (aminooxy) acetic acid (AOA), prevented the forma tion of cortical air space and completely inhibits 1005 mRNA accumula tion under flooding. AOA treatment exhibited little effect on the mRNA accumulation encoded by adh1 showing that it did not cause overall suppression of flooding-responsive genes. Moreover, ethylene treatment under aerobic conditions brings about aerenchyma development along with 1005 induction in both organs. These findings specify that 1005 is responsive to ethylene. Treatment with anoxia, which overwhelms ethylene accumulation and aerenchyma development, also caused 1005 induction. But, in contrast to flooding, AOA treatment under anoxia did not affect 1005 mRNA accumulation, showing that 1005 is induced through various mechanisms under flooding (hypoxia) and anoxia (Saab and Sachs, 1996).",

Responses of different morphophysiological traits, except days to 50% anthesis, differed consid erably. The superiority of hybrid progenies over parental inbred lines was elevated under EM stress. This suggested that these hybrids were more tolerant to EM stress than inbred progenies. Across moisture regimes, all morphophysiological traits of hybrids, except lodging and root porosity under normal moisture, showed a positive and significant correlation with midparent traits. Therefore, their study data has proposed that per se performance of lines was comparatively an additional key factor in defining hybrid performance under EM stress, while under optimum soil moisture conditions midparent heterosis was comparatively more important than per se performance of midparent. Phenotypic correlation between hybrid and midparent yields exhibited a strong association under EM stress (r = 0.66 ** ). The association was statistically significant under normal moisture as well, though it was relatively weak (r = 0.41 * ). Their results suggested that under EM, the performance of hybrid progenies can be predicted and enhanced to some extent based on their inbred parents that have been scientifically selected and improved for EM stress.

This increase in enzyme activities was more marked in the salt-tolerant genotypes. Salt stress did not have much significant effect on catalase (CAT) activity in the salt-tolerant genotype. In salt-stressed roots of the salt-tolerant genotype, SOD and CAT activities were reduced and APX, GPX, and GR activities remained unchanged. In the roots of the salt-sensitive genotype, salinity led to a reduction in the activity of the above enzymes. In both leaves and roots, CAT and GPX enzymes showed the maximum H 2 O 2 scavenger activity. Furthermore, CAT, APX, and GPX activities in conjunction with SOD seemed to play a significant protective role in the scavenging processes. Lipid peroxidation was improved only in salt-stressed leaves of the salt-sensitive genotype. Their findings indicated that oxidative stress may perform a significant role in salt-stressed maize plants and that the greater protection of BR5033 leaves and roots from salt-induced oxidative damage results, at least in part, because of the maintenance and/or increase of the antioxidant enzymes activity.",

(2006) investigated how NO regulates Na + , K + ion homeostasis in maize. Pretreatment with 100 μm SNP for 2 days enhanced later growth of maize plants under 100 mMNaCl stress, which was showed by improved dry matter accumulation, increased chlorophyll content, and reduced membrane leakage from leaf cells. An NO scavenger, methylene blue (MB-1), blocked the effect of SNP. The study findings showed that SNPderived NO improved maize tolerance to salt stress. Additional analysis revealed that NaCl induced a transient increase in the NO level in maize leaves. Both NO and NaCl treatment stimulated vacuolar H + -ATPase and H + -PPase activities, leading to increased H + -translocation and Na + /H + exchange. NaCl-induced H + -ATPase and H + -PPase activities were reduced by MB-1. 1-Butanol, an inhibitor of phosphatidic acid (PA) production by phospholipase D (PLD), reduced NaCl-and NO-induced H + -ATPase activation. On the other hand, applied PA stimulated H + -ATPase activity. Therefore, the study suggested that NO acts as a signal molecule in the NaCl response by rising the activities of vacuolar H + -ATPase and H + -PPase, which offers the driving force for Na + /H + exchange. PLD and PA play a significant role in this process.",

Maize seeds were given presoaking treatments of NaCl (0, 50, 100, and 200 mM) in both the presence and absence of 0.5 mM salicylic acid. Two-week-old maize seedlings exhibited significant decreases in dry weight, root length, shoot length, and leaf area on 6 h exposure of 100 and 200 mMNaCl stress. Photosynthetic pigments and NR activity in leaves declined sharply with increasing stress levels. Under saline conditions, an increment was observed in both proline content and lipid peroxidation (measured in terms of MDA) levels. But, seedlings pretreated with 0.5 mM salicylic acid together with the salinity levels have shown improvement in growth parameters, photosynthetic pigments, NR activity whereas, free proline and MDA levels got reduced. The results showed that salt-induced deleterious effect in maize seedlings was significantly encountered by the pretreatment of salicylic acid. It is resolved that 0.5 mM salicylic acid increases the adaptability of maize plants to NaCl stress. Cramer et al. (1994) tested the proposition that accumulation of Na + in the shoot in maize has a negative association with salt tolerance. Salt tolerance is described as a percentage of the control on a dry weight basis. Two hybrids (Pioneer hybrid 3578 and Pioneer hybrid 3772) varying extensively in Na + accumulation were compared. Plants were treated with two types of salinity for 15 days (80 mol m -3 NaCl or 80 mol m -3 NaCl plus 8.75 mol m -3 CaCl 2 ). Ion concentrations (Na + , K + , Ca 2+ , and Cl -) were measured in the roots, stalks, sheaths, and leaves of plants harvested every third day. Ion concentrations were significantly influenced by the treatments. Salinity treatments increased the Na + and Cl -concentrations and K + and Ca 2+ concentrations. Further increase of Ca 2+ reduced Na + concentrations. Hybrid 3772 retained very low Na + concentrations in the shoots, whereas 3578 did not. The ability to transport Na + to the shoot was the major difference between the hybrids hybrid; 3578 transported Na + at twice the rate of hybrid 3772. Generally, ion transport to the shoot seemed to be a function of root ion concentration. This model could account for the effects of NaCl salinity and supplemental Ca 2+ onion transport, though Na + transport was made complex by an apparent reabsorption mechanism in the root and mesocotyl. The absence of association of Na + accumulation in the shoot and other ion parameters with growth showed that the mineral nutrition of the plants was not associated with salt tolerance. It was determined that the growth response of maize to salinity was mainly affected by osmotic factors.",

The yields of maize under salt stress may exhibit a decline due to a reduction in the kernel setting rather than declined grain filling. Hütsch et al.

The findings showed that there was a significant decline in the GYs, which were the resultant of a 50% decline in the kernel number. However, it was found that in both these hybrids there was hardly any limitation in source, where the concentrations of sucrose in the kernels of both these hybrids were found at increased levels even under salt stress. In contrast to the increased concentrations of sucrose in the kernels, the concentrations of glucose and fructose were lower. A considerable decline (19%) in the soluble acid invertase activity was seen in kernels 5 days after pollination under hydroponically grown plants, while there was a reduction of 50% in the activity in kernels of those grown under soil culture experiment at 2 days after pollination. Though the decline in the enzyme activity was identical in both the sensitive as well as moderately tolerant hybrids, the highest soluble acid invertase activity that resulted at 2 days after pollination exhibited a sharp decline until 8 days after pollination in soil grown plants in Pioneer 3906. Thus, the results determined that a reduction in the acid invertase activity is the main factor related to the limitation of kernel setting apart from other genotypic variabilities.",

The species of Dalbulus that specialize on gamagrasses were morphologically more primitive than D. maidis and D. elimatus. This indicated that Tripsacum is the ancestral host genus of Dalbulus. The evolution of Dalbulus might have driven by geographic isolation and host specialization. Afterward, when maize was first domesticated from its teosinte relatives, it adopted maize as a host. As the maize habitat is movable, the leafhoppers specializing maize should overwinter as hardy, mobile adults. Further, evidence suggested that maize pathogens such as Spiroplasma kunkelii and the maize bushy stunt mycoplasma have developed nonpathogenic, mutualistic associations with improved Dalbulus vector species (Nault, 1990).",

Here, simple sequence repeat (SSR) analysis was conducted in an F 2 population obtained from the \"Qi319×340\" cross. Twenty SSR primer pairs were dispersed on chromosome10 and screened for resistant gene. Only two primer pairs, phi118 and phi 041, exhibited association with SCR resistance. On the basis of these results, eight novel SSR primer pairs flanking the region of primers, phi118 and phi 041, were picked chosen and verified for their association with RppQ. The findings showed that SSR markers, umc1,318 and umc2,018, were linked to RppQ with a genetic distance of 4.76 and 14.59 cM, respectively. On the other side of RppQ, away from SSR markers phi 041 and phi118, another SSR marker umc1,293 was linked to RppQ with 3.78 cM of genetic distance. As the five linkages SSR markers were detected on chromosome 10, the RppQ gene was expected to be situated on chromosome 10. Further, AFLP (amplified fragment length polymorphism) analysis was undertaken to fine map the RppQ gene. Out of 54 AFLP primer combinations analyzed, only one marker AF1 exhibited linkage with the RppQ gene in a genetic distance of 3.34 cM.

First, the entomophagous insects that play a key role in regulating maize pests, and which may be at risk because of transgenic plants should be determined. As the risk which transgenic plants cause to entomophagous insects depends on both, their contact, and their sensitivity to the insecticidal protein, at what level organisms are subjected to the transgene compound should be determined at the second step. Exposure is related with the feeding behavior of phytophagous and entomophagous insects along with the tissue-and cell-specific temporal and spatial expression of the insecticidal protein.

Then, these primers were utilized to amplify sequences from maize genomic DNA by means of polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Eleven classes of noncross-hybridizing sequences were found. These sequences had expected products with high levels of amino acid resemblance to NBS-LRR resistance proteins. Further, 20 restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) loci were mapped in maize using these maize resistance gene analogs (RGAs) and one RGA clone acquired earlier from wheat as probes. Few RFLPs mapped the genomic regions with virus and fungus resistance genes and the RGA loci exhibited a complete co-segregation with the rust resistance loci rp1 and rp3. These findings suggested that the RGA clones may hybridize to resistance genes (Collins et al., 1998).",

Roots below 15 cm were less in mulch treatment than the control. In the surface layers, interrow compaction inhibited the lateral spread of roots leading to downward growth of roots. Reduction of soil temperature by 2.6°C was observed at the 5-cm soil depth in mulched plots. Further, the reductions in soil temperature and moisture losses in mulched plots were found to be associated with greater lateral spread and improved root growth in the surface layers resulting in improved plant growth and higher yield (Chaudhary and Prihar, 1974).",

          "text": "In many crops and maize, there were decreases in yield with a delay in the sowing dates. The declined yields may be the resultant of reduced seed number, size, and unfilled grains. In addition, a disruption in the supply of assimilates to the developing kernels, or in the activity of sinks might also contribute to declining yields. Limitation of either the source or the sink may contribute to the reduced yields also. Though a number of studies have been performed on the effects of delayed sowing on yields, yet it remained unclear, whether, the declined yields are the resultant of a decline in the source strength and activity or due to a decline in sick strength and activity. Optimization of crop management practices is possible, only when there is a clear understanding of the relationships of source-sink and also when critical processes are identified. Effective breeding strategies can be developed. Bonelli et al. (2016) assessed the effect of delayed sowing date on the grain yield components as well as on source-sink relationships at Balcarce, Argentina, for three consecutive cropping season years. The crop was sown at varied sowing dates from October to January, during which there was a large seasonal photothermal variation. Late sowing in January resulted in a drastic decline in grain yields. The proportionate decrease in grain number was less in comparison to a decline of grain weight per grain, with a delay in sowing date. Large differences in grain yield are found to be linked closely to that of the harvest index. With a delay in the sowing dates, there was a decline in the accumulation of dry matter (DM) in the postsilking period, which resulted in variations in the harvest index. With variation from early to late sowing dates, there were differences in the source capacity and sink strength. The differences in source capacity were more pronounced rather than the variations in the sink strength, particularly during the grain-filling period, there was much reduction in the source/sink ratio. Findings specify that crop growth during the grain-filling period is limited to a large extent by a limitation in sink strength at the early sowing days, while the limitation of photosynthetic source capacity acted as a limiting factor during the time of late sowing. Tsimba et al. (2013) evaluated the effects of varied planting dates (18 September to 15 December) in six maize hybrids of varying maturity levels in Waikato and Manawatu regions of New Zealand (2006 and2007) on leaf growth rates, grain yields, and yield components. An increase in the daily mean temperature (13-19°C) at once preceding to tassel initiation resulted in a decline in the leaf number by 0.1 leaf °C-1 was observed. However, these hybrids exhibited the largest leaf area indices at daily temperatures of 17-19°C. Early plantings of maize hybrids resulted in maximum grain yields in the Waikato regions, possessing a lower latitude environment. In contrast, declined yields, resulted from the early plantings at Manawatu regions were due to the prevalence of low temperatures during the spring season, due to these low temperatures, the hybrids grown under early plantings produced canopies of smaller size. Though early hybrids produced consistent yields across varied planting dates, late hybrids when planted early out yielded these early hybrids. The late hybrids when planted early had a better balanced source-sink ratio. Further, late plantings also resulted in declined yields due to the existence of low temperatures (15-18°C) and radiation (11-20 MJ m -2 day -1 ) during the grain-filling periods. Grain yield was found to be in strong association with the kernel number and weight in these hybrids. Response of these hybrids to planting dates, water stress, temperature, and irradiance was more pronounced in late hybrids in their kernel number, kernel weight as well as grain yield. Water stress effects seen on the grain filling was found to have minimal effects during the late plantings. Kernel number was more affected by water stress, though a stable performance was found among these hybrids in their kernel weight. In conclusion, the results revealed that late plantings in maize result in a decline in the biomass production and harvest index.",

In this study, the yield potential, yield gaps, and the effect of agronomic practices on both parameters were quantified in irrigated maize systems of central Nebraska. Three years data with field-specific values for yield, applied irrigation, and N fertilizer rate were used for the analysis. By means of a maize simulation model together with actual and interpolated weather records yield potential was estimated. Then from a subset of fields, complete data on crop management was collected. The variance between actual yields and simulated Y P for each field-year observation was taken into account to estimate yield gaps. Further, longterm simulation analysis was carried out to assess the sensitivity of Y P to variations in selected management practices. Findings revealed that present irrigated maize systems reached the Y P ceiling. In the USA, the mean actual yield varied from 12.5 to 13.6 Mg ha -1 across years and the mean N fertilizer efficiency was 23% greater than average efficiency. It was found that rotation, tillage system, sowing date, and plant population density were the most sensitive factors and had a direct correlation with actual yields. Time trends in mean farm yields from 1970 to 2008 showed that yields have not improved during the past eight years. Based on present crop management practices the average yield reached ~80% of Y P ceiling during this period. Simulation analysis has shown that Y P can be improved by higher plant population densities and by hybrids with longer maturity, but the implementation of these practices may have some constraints like trouble in planting and harvest operations because of wet weather and snow, additional costs of seed and grain drying, and high frost and lodging risks. Finally, the study suggested that the maize produced under irrigated conditions reached the Y P ceiling and high levels of N-use efficiency and further improvement can be made by fine-tuning present management practices (Grassini et al., 2011).",

In this study, the utility of the kernel milk line as a visual means of observing grain maturity in maize was evaluated. In five maize hybrids, the movement of kernel milk line was observed and compared with the moisture loss, accumulation of dry weight, and development of black layer in the kernels. To characterize the movement of kernel milk-line under prematurity stress, leaves from four hybrids were removed at different kernel development stages. Under normal conditions, kernel milk line disappearance was coincident with the development of the black layer and physiological maturity (PM). Though it was easy to ascertain the day on which milk in kernels was no longer present than to find when the placental region turns black. Therefore, the movement of the milk line could be used in monitoring the maturity process (Fig. 9.1). At the half-milk stage, kernels attained 90% of their dry weight, with 40% moisture, while the completely defoliated plants accumulated 95% of normal dry weight. At this stage, plants were 2-3 weeks from the optimum date to initiate harvest. So the study recommended that both the black layer development and kernel milk line disappearance can be used as indicators of maturity in maize. However, the kernel milk line was more useful in timing grain maturity before PM and the development of the black layer was the more dependable indicator of PM (Afuakwa and Crookston, 1984).",

Many studies suggested that the source-sink ratio may have an influence on the dynamics of kernel water relations during grain filling and, thus, GM at PM. To examine this probability, the reproductive sink capacity or the assimilate availability during grain filling was manipulated in maize treatments. Throughout the grain-filling kernel dry weight, water content, and the dry weight to water content (D-W) ratio, were observed. In each treatment gain moisture at PM was estimated by using a bilinear model relating dry weight and GM. It was found that the restriction of source capacity during grain filling increases GM at PM. However, the increment of source capacity per kernel did not show any effect on GM at PM. A single model explained the association between dry weight and GM for all hybrids and treatments without reduction of source capacity during grain filling. This model assessed 34.9% of GM at PM. These findings suggested that the measurement of GM at the late grain-filling stage could be a reliable estimate of PM when the source capacity was not severely limited. All the source-sink treatments had a similar D-W ratio of developing kernels till PM. However, premature termination of grain filling caused by defoliation resulted in desiccation of kernels and thus, increased the D-W ratio (Sala et al., 2007).",

However, cob, stover, total crop residue, and total biomass DM yield exhibited a decreasing trend with increasing maturity stage and this decline in stover yield was due to leaf loss. With the reduction in GM content from 30% to 10%, a significant decrease in crop residue-grain ratio and leaf-stem ratio and a significant increase in the harvest index and grain hectoliter weight were observed. The highest stover ash content was obtained in maize harvested at stage I.

The association between dry-weight per kernel and ear moisture was found to be constant for Pioneer 3901 studied over five seasons, but it exhibited variations at the grain-filling stage.

Here, the applicability of PICS to maize storage was evaluated. The naturally infested maize with high levels of P. truncatus, S. zeamais, and R. dominica infestation were stored in PICS bags at seven locations. After 6.5 months of storage insect mortality of 95-100% was observed at all sites. Seed viability and germination rates of seeds were well maintained in PICS bags. The damaged seeds percentage and the 100 seeds weights did not show any difference from what was noted at the beginning of the experiment. Further aflatoxin tests were performed on 245 samples. In both PICS and woven bags, an aflatoxin level of above 20 ppm was recorded in 53% of the samples. The level of contamination in samples from PICS bags was much less than those from woven bags. So maize grains can be effectively stored in PICS bags in areas with a high incidence of P. truncatus, but to reduce bag damage due to P. truncatus the maize grains should be packed in PICS bags immediately after harvest and drying (Baoua et al., 2014).",

So, grains should be dried to safe moisture levels before storage to protect them from microbial damage. But in developing countries, the drying of produce to these moisture levels may not be economical for farmers. In such situations, preservation of grains under hermetic storage at intermediate moisture levels could be feasible and economical. In this study, the influence of different moisture contents (MC) on the quality of maize grains was examined in self-regulated modified atmospheres during hermetic storage. Initially, maize was conditioned at 14%, 16%, 18%, 20%, and 22% MC. for 28 days in tightly wrapped plastic bags and later stored in sealed containers at 30°C for 75 days. The oxygen in bags was replaced with CO 2 . The reduction in O 2 depletion time, namely, from 600 h at 14% MC to 12 h at 22% was observed with the increment in MC. The maximum DM losses, the lowest germination rates and the highest yeast and bacteria counts were recorded in maize at 20% and 22% MC. In the hermetically sealed maize, the major fermentation product was ethanol (0-5 g kg -1 DM), together with acetic acid (0-1 g kg -1 DM) at low concentrations. In vitro experiment findings indicated that maize could be stored satisfactorily at the tested moisture levels under sealed conditions where self-regulated atmospheres protect the produce from microbial damage. However, the economic feasibility of storing high-moisture maize will need to be tested in further large-scale trials (Weinberg et al., 2008).",

Conventional agriculture involves practices such as reduced tillage, permanent soil cover, and crop rotations to improve soil fertility and to provide food from a declining land resource. Therefore, the factors influencing crop yield under conservation agriculture and rain-fed conditions need to be identified. In this chapter, the influence of long-term tillage and retention of residue on maize grain yield was assessed under different soil textures, nitrogen input, and climatic conditions. Stability analysis was used to measure the yield variability. In low rainfall areas, increased maize yield was noted with the conservation agriculture practices such as rotation and high input use, but the stability system did not show any variation under low rainfall areas. Annual rainfall showed a strong association with maize grain yield. The metaanalysis results revealed that (i) mulching in high rainfall areas may reduce yields because of water logging; (ii) for the temporal development of conservation agriculture effects soil texture is important and well-drained soils improves maize yield; (iii) for improved yield conservation agriculture practices need inputs particularly N; (iv) reduced tillage without mulching lowers yield in semiarid areas; (v) when sufficient fertilizer is available, rainfall is the key determinant of yield in southern Africa. Thus, the study findings clearly indicated that to improve the impact of conservation agriculture on yield it should be targeted and adapted to specific biophysical conditions (Rusinamhodzi et al., 2011).",

Highest grain yield (5.3 Mg ha -1 ) and kernel weight (26.62 mg) were recorded in the hybrid 8644-27. Average grain protein yield per unit area did not show a significant difference among cultivars. In comparison, the percentage of floaters was higher in the cultivars 8644-27 and TZPB-SR at 30-60 kg N ha -1 .

The low light at different stages significantly affected the protein body number in maize endosperm. Moreover, the reductions in degree of connection, nutrient transport capacity, and mitochondrion number of the transfer cell were observed after shading. The variation in grain quality under shade was found to be due to the increase in embryo and endosperm proportion. The variations in the morphology and functions of transfer cell endosperm and the lack of energy limited the nutrient transport significantly with shading at different stages, indicating that a blocked flux may be the reason for the reduction of maize grain weight at later growth stage under low light condition (Shi-fang et al., 2011).",

Owing to small farm sizes, maize stores from home production lasted a median of 3 months. Young Ethiopian children were at risk of insufficient quality protein consumptions, mainly after breastfeeding has stopped and during food insecurity. QPM could lessen this risk; however, dependence on access through home production may bring about only short-term benefits given the inadequate quantities of maize produced and stored (Gunaratna et al., 2019). maize, significant improvements of stalk standability, stalk rot, and lodging resistance have been accomplished. The physiological variations related to these improvements were delayed senescence of leaves and stems, higher grain filling rate, and higher stress tolerance.

The two tools interact so strongly that neither of them could have made such advancement lonely. But, in future years genetic gains may have to bear a larger share of the load. Over the years many varia tions were observed in hybrid traits. Most frequent changes were noticed in the traits that increases resistance to various biotic and abiotic stresses. However, morphological and physiological variations that stimulate the growth, development, and partitioning efficiency were also documented. Some traits such as grain maturity date in US Corn Belt have not altered over the years because breeders have intended to keep them constant. While, other traits like harvest index have not changed, in spite of breeders' inten tion to change them. Though breeders have constantly selected for high yield, the necessity to select concurrently for overall reliability has been a driving force in the selection of hybrids with greater stress tolerance over the years. Modern hybrids yield more than their ancestors under both unfavor able and favorable growing environments. The main driving force of the higher yielding ability of modern hybrid was improvement in the capability of the maize plant to overwhelm both biotic and abiotic stresses, rather than increase in primary productivity (Duvick, 2005).",

In recent years, the genome sequencing of a highly popular US Corn Belt inbred B73 and a popcorn landrace in Mexico, Palomero were significant milestones in maize research. Next-generation sequencing and high-throughput genotyping approaches have the potential to promote our knowledge of genetic diversity and for planning approaches to use the genomic information for the improvement of maize. But, high-throughput and precision phenotyping are the major limiting factor to make use of the genetic diversity in crops like maize. Therefore, there is a crucial need to found a global phenotyping network for complete and effective characterization of maize germplasm for a range of target characters, especially for biotic and abiotic stress resistance and nutritional quality. CIMMYT has initiated a new initiative \"Seeds of Discovery\" (SeeD) for intensive study of phenotypic and molecular diversity of maize germplasm preserved in the CIMMYT Gene Bank. This initiative is likely to help in efficient documentation and utilization of new alleles and haplotypes for maize improvement. Worldwide multi-institutional efforts are needed to thoroughly investigate the maize germplasm to differentiate the genetic base of elite breeding materials, produce new varieties, and counteract the impacts of global climate change (Prasanna, 2012).",

In spite of remarkable advancement achieved in the last few decades via conventional breeding in Asia, average maize yields continue to be low and the demand for maize is predicted to surpass the production in the upcoming years. In the United States and in other places molecular marker-assisted breeding has accelerated the maize yield gains. This method proposes remarkable potential for improving the productivity and value of Asian maize germplasm. The present chapter discussed the significance of such attempts in encountering the increasing demand for maize and provided examples of the latest uses of molecular markers with regard to (1) DNA fingerprinting and genetic diversity analysis of maize germplasm, (2) QTL analysis of major biotic and abiotic stresses, and (3) marker-assisted selection (MAS) for improvement of maize. Further, it highlighted the problems confronted by research institutes desiring to implement the existing and developing molecular technologies. The study concluded that to enhance the level and scope of molecular marker-assisted breeding for maize improvement in Asia, innovative models for resource pooling and intellectual property respecting partnerships will be needed. Scientists should confirm that the molecular marker-assisted breeding tools are determined to develop commercially viable cultivars, improved to ameliorate the most significant constraints in maize production (Prasanna et al., 2010).",

For these 14 inbred lines, allozyme genotypes at 14 loci and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) variant types for 52 cDNA clones were acquired. A measure of genetic distance between inbreds based on marker data viz Modified Roger's distance (MRD) values did not show a significant correlation with hybrid yields. But, a hybrid value based on the number of marker loci with the highest yielding genotype exhibited a significant correlation with hybrid yield. Cluster analysis of MRD values was in agreement with pedigree information but did not show consistency with groupings based on yield. In hybrids with distantly related parents, a relative association measure based on the proportion of homomorphic marker loci showed a significant correlation with a measure of association on the basis of yield (Dudley et al., 1991).",

It helps to understand the genetic basis of these traits and to plan new plant improvement programs. In this chapter, QTLs for seven key traits including grain yield were mapped in two elite maize inbred lines, B73 and Mo17. Two important events in maize genetics-heterosis (hybrid vigor) and genotype-by-environment (G x E) interaction were investigated. Further, two analytical methods of QTL identification viz., the traditional single-marker method and the more recent, interval mapping method were compared. About 3168 maize plots with 100,000 plants cultivated in 3 states were evaluated phenotypically with the help of 76 markers. Both analytical methods provided similar results in the identification of QTLs related with grain yield all over the genome except on chromosome 6. Whenever a QTL related with grain yield was identified, the heterozygote showed a higher phenotype than the relevant homozygote. This suggested that not only overdominance or pseudo-overdominance but also the identified QTLs play a major role in heterosis. This inference was strengthened by a strong association between grain yield and the proportion of heterozygous markers. Though plants were cultivated and evaluated in six different environments, G x E interaction was not evident for most QTLs (Stuber et al., 1992).",

With increasing plant population more drastically increased barrenness, extended anthesis-silking interval and reduced kernel set per ear was observed in the older than in the modern hybrid. The improved performance of modern hybrids at supra optimum plant densities was found to be favored by three sets of traits. Primarily, by lesser partition of dry matter to the tassel, that stimulates a more balanced allometric associa tion between male and female inflorescence. Second, by more compact canopy architecture of modern hybrids, with dwarf plants, fewer and more upright leaves, that enhances interception of solar radiation.

For machine-harvestable grain yield, the optimum plant density was found to increase with the year of hybrid introduction, whereas for total grain yield it increased from old to more recent hybrids. It was found that the reduced stem lodging contributes to about one-third of the genetic gain in machine-harvestable grain yield.

Nine plant populations varying from c. 30,000 to 140,000 plants/ha and nitrogen (N) doses, nil and 250 kg N/ha were applied as treatments. Increased grain yield was recorded in plots applied with nitrogen in all the population range. In plots applied with limited N, incre ment in ear and grain yield was observed with population up to c. 90,000 plants/ha, and then remained constant. More marked effects of limited -N were recorded at high (>90,000 plants/ha) populations. Quality traits like ear size, tip fill, and individual grain mass improved consistently with the addition of N throughout the range of 30,000-140,000 plants/ha. However, the reduction in ear size, tip fill, and individual grain mass was observed with population, irrespective of N supply. Therefore, the study concluded that the optimum balance should be maintained between population and N supply to improve the yield and quality of super sweet corn (Stone et al., 1998). A natural genetic mutant of vegetable corns, viz. waxy or glutinous corn (Zea mays L. var. ceratina) was found in China. As native waxy corns are open-pollinated with varying ear size, ear shape, kernel color and eating quality, novel hybrids with unique eating quality and appearance can be developed. At Plant Breeding Research Center for Sustainable Agriculture, a waxy corn hybrid breeding program was initiated to develop new varieties with improved eating quality and ear appearance. Two separate base populations were developed by collecting waxy corn cultivars from Thailand and China and super sweet corn cultivars from Thailand and the United States. Inbred lines were obtained and crossed to develop singlecross hybrids. Thus, two single-crossed glutinous corn hybrids viz., white and bicolored hybrids were developed. These were the first glutinous corn hybrids with 75% waxy kernels and 25% super sweet kernels. These hybrids have extra sweetness and delightful eating quality. Both hybrids produced well filled ear with 12-16 rows and can be harvested at about 60 days after planting (Lertrat and Thongnarin, 2008).",

The main advantages of DH lines in hybrid breeding are (1) highest genetic variance, (2) complete homozygosity, (3) short \"time to market\", (4) simplified logistics, (5) low expenses, and (6) optimum ability for marker applications. This chapter reviewed the experimental basis of the haploid induction technology, elucidated alternate DH-line-based breeding systems, described the characteristics of novel software for improving such systems, and discussed carefully chosen optimization results. Modern inducer genotypes showed average induction rates of 8-10%. Different morphological and physiological markers permit a rapid and cheap identification of haploid kernels or seedlings. Artificial chromosome doubling techniques have been effectively adapted on a large-scale for commercial uses. Probably, haploid embryogenesis is a result of defective sperm cells. The maternal haploids induction rate is under polygenic control. Genome-wide markerassisted selection can efficiently be combined with DH-line-based breeding approaches. The loss of genetic variation can be lessened by setting lower limits to the effective population size (N e ) so as to maintain selection response in the long run. New software MBP (Version 1.0) exploits the estimated annual genetic gain subjected to budget and N e limitations. Software input variables contain assessed variance and covariance components, type of tester, haploid induction parameters, and individual breeding activities costs. To calculate N e , the software takes into account genetic drift caused by both sampling and selection. The optimization outcomes demonstrated that the breeding approaches which involve only one stage of testcross assessment provide faster breeding progress than those with two or more stages and genetic interlinking between staggered breeding programs is more effective than a closed-population method (Geiger and Gordillo, 2009).",

Prevalent regulatory variation was detected with about 70% of ~17,000 genes revealing evidence of regulatory divergence between maize and teosinte. However, many genes (1,079 genes) showed constant cis differences with all sampled maize and teosinte lines. For ~70% of these 1,079 genes, the cis differences were limited to a single tissue. Ear tissue had a greater number of genes with cis-regulatory differences, which experienced a drastic transformation in form during domestication. As expected from the domestication bottleneck, maize has less cis-regulatory variation than teosinte, this shortage of genes controlling maize-teosinte cis-regulatory divergence, suggested selection on cis-regulatory differences Research Advances in Breeding and Biotechnology of Maize during domestication. Reliable with selection on cis-regulatory elements, genes with cis effects showed a strong correlation with genes under positive selection during maize domestication and improvement, while genes with trans-regulatory effects did not. They found a directional bias such that genes with cis differences exhibited higher expression of the maize allele more frequently than the teosinte allele, suggesting domestication preferred up-regulation of gene expression. Lastly, this study provides evidence of the cis and trans-regulatory variations between maize and teosinte in over 17,000 genes for three tissues.",

          "text": "In plants, many key regulatory genes that control plant growth and development have been recognized and characterized. In spite of broad information on the function of these genes, much is not known about how they contribute to the natural variation for complex traits. To ascertain whether major regulatory genes of maize contribute to standing variation in Balsas teosinte, Weber et al. (2007) conducted association mapping in 584 Balsas teosinte individuals. They tested 48 markers from 9 candidate regulatory genes against 13 traits for plant and inflorescence architecture. A mixed linear model that regulates multiple levels of relatedness was used to find significant associations. Ten associations comprising five candidate genes were significant after correction for multiple testing, and two endure the conservative Bonferroni correction. zfl2, the maize homolog of FLORICAULA of Antirrhinum, was linked with plant height. zap1, the maize homolog of APETALA1 of Arabidopsis, was linked with inflorescence branching. Five SNPs in the maize domestication gene, teosinte branched1, were significantly linked with either plant or inflorescence architecture. The study findings suggested that major regulatory genes in maize do play a role in the natural variation for complex traits in teosinte and that some of the minor variants detected may have been targets of selection during domestication.",

The wild relatives of maize, collectively known as teosinte, are a more diverse and characteristic study system than many other model flowering plants.
