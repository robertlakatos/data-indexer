In air-dry kernels, the intensity of respiration is negligible, but more than 15% moisture may cause substantial losses in dry matter as well as in the inner quality of the kernel. The intensity of respiration is higher than in the other cereal crops because the relative size and energy content of the germ is more important. Loss caused by respiration is 2-3 times larger in maize than in wheat grains. Respiration is a product of enzymatic activity, which in turn has strictly set conditions. Especially the enzymes: amylase, lipase and dehydrates stimulate the intensity of respiration.

The reason of it is that the borderline of evaporation passed into the deeper region of the seed, the epidermis get shrivelled forming a glass-like, hard, water proof layer around the germ, where the water content keeps declining. In the seed, an inhomogeneous structure of temperature and moisture zones is developed, and on the outer surface fissures thin as hair may develop (Vas & Beke 1977).",

The speed of the air does not impair the biological value of maize up until a critical degree. If the speed does not surpass the 0.8 m/s referred to the entire surface of the pile, no considerable damage would be expected. The convectional drying constructions in Hungary are able to comply with those requirements. The maximal speed of the flux is also influenced by the installation. It is a fundamental criterion that the speed should not surpass the threshold of fluttering near the wind-channels. The constructs based on the principle of gravitation trickling with air channels or shutters are susceptible to higher-thanallowed speeds of the drying medium. The columns of the produce moving by gravity tend to split into parts of different speed. An inadmissible heterogeneity arises in the temperature as well as in the final moisture content of the produce. In dryers of cross-flow, the excessive speed endangers the arching over of the produce, subsequently, the throwing out of the grain, which is otherwise also very dangerous. The impurity of the harvested kernels increases the deleterious effects. According to practical experiences, the maize harvested with combine and precleaned before being rendered to the tower dryer working on the principle of gravity trickling. At the end of the drying channel no higher than 8-10 m/s speed of the flux should be allowed.",

Browning is a result of reactions going on in proteins and lipids. The higher the content in proteins, the more intense is the browning. Within the kernel, the germ gets brown first by drying. The mealy endosperm (as containing less protein) is not impaired practically by discoloration. The degradation of the nutritive value is due to the change in essential amino acids. Lysine deserves special attention because the increasing temperature applied accelerates its degradation, at the same time, as a result of long-term feeding experiments; there is a close positive correlation between the lysine content of maize and the gain of weight of the experimental animals.",

The kernels are especially susceptible to high temperatures (mainly at the beginning and near to the end of the process). It would be ideal, if during the loss of water, the temperature of the drying machine would be altered -according to the requirement of the produce -in order to follow the borderline of being damaged without surpassing it. The temperature of the medium to be applied depends also on the relative moisture content of kernels. Higher moisture content may allow higher temperatures without risking damage. The construction of the dryer ought to be taken into account as well. Finally, the drying process should be planned carefully by considering the energy requirement, the risk of loosing quality and secure the storage of the produce for a longer time. For the elaboration of the procedure, a sample of 2.5% (in % of dry matter) lysine content and a moisture content of 14% were chosen. The reduction of lysine content was limited to 10%. The intersection of curves drawing the temperature used for drying (w) and the curve signalising 14% moisture content as a conditions of storability, moreover, the curve of the loss in lysine content (AL) shows the limits of storability. A similar method claiming 10% loss of lysine (AL=0.25% of the dry matter) shows the time, which is still temperature of the store (S√∂r√∂s & Komka 1995). The conditions of storability are displayed in The development of the storing technology of maize aimed to find procedures, which may possibly keep the product sane and secure for a longer period independently from the conditions of its moisture content.

If the atmosphere of the store is isolated, the oxygen gets depleted and is soon substituted with carbon dioxide, which stops respiration and any aerobic process; therefore the loss of material is also stopped.
