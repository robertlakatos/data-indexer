The aim of the research was the assessment of the swarming dynamics and damage of the western corn rootworm (WCR) adults and larvae. The experiment was carried out in monoculture fertilization long-term experiments and three maize hybrids compared for their reaction against WCR adult and larval damage under non-infested plots at different nitrogen levels. Differences among the hybrids have a lower effect on the damage of corn rootworm adults and larvae than the amount of applied nitrogen. The phosphorus-potassium are optimal levels, while nitrogen ranges from 0 to 300 kg and no nutrient supply took place in the control plots for 30 years. The number of adults located and feeding on the styles of the female flower recorded and the damage caused on the roots by larvae ranked on a modified Iowa scale. Nitrogen fertilization resulted in a change in the silking time. The lowest root damage observed",

Agricultural production might be threatened by various invasive species as their damage might result in tens of millions of dollars in income loss (Pimentel et al., 2000(Pimentel et al., , 2003)). Currently, climate change has an impact on global food production (Ray et al., 2019), which may be the driving force behind the spread and establishment of new pests in areas that used to be disadvantageous for them in the past. In the area involved in the study, the average of the summer periods between April and September of the last 5 years showed a positive temperature difference each year compared to the annual average (Gombos & Nagy, 2019). Based on the above, it can be concluded that numerous new pests might emerge that were previously not widespread in our area due to temperature-related limiting factors.",

It is a species of tropical origin with a gene center in Mexico (Smith, 1966); its first economic damage was done to sweet corn in the early 20th century (Gillette, 1912). According to the earliest observations, its first European appearance might have taken place in 1989-1990(Sivcev et al., 1996)); however, later research suggests that 5-6 years have passed between the appearance of the first specimens and the experienced economic damage of larvae, so probably the species was in Europe already in the mid-1980s (Edwards et al., 1998;Kiss et al., 2001).

According to recent research, each root cut by larvae causes a 15% loss of yield (Tinsley et al. 2013).

Significant economic loss may occur in the case of the severe damage of styles (Culy et al., 1992). As a result, maize ears are deficient in terms of seed formation, as pollens are unable to pollinate damaged styles (Basetti & Westgate, 1993). Adults detect the volatile substance emitted by the stigma and then seek their food following it (Prystupa et al., 1988).

Also, there are different types of insecticides, the application of which depends on the production or management system of the producer and the available equipment. The most common defense against larvae is the application of soil disinfectant at the time of sowing. Adults can be treated with wide-spectrum insecticides and insecticides with species-specific nutritional attractants, either with the aerial application or with the use of straddle tractors (Boriani et al., 2006). With the emergence of genetically modified plants, resistance against this pest has also been developed. In the United States, transgenic Bt maize expresses Cry endotoxin proteins derived from the soil bacterium Bacillus. Berliner Thuringiensis (Bt), which can significantly reduce the economic damage caused by the pest. Advantages of Bt maize include effective pest control (Storer et al., 2006), reduced use of wide-spectrum insecticides (Phipps & Park 2002), and consequently, reduction of the damage of non-target species by chemical protection (Al-Deeb & Wilde, 2003;Lundgren & Wiedenmann, 2002).",

The classic solution of this is to import and spread natural enemies from their North American origins.

The earlier silking maize specimens were potentially more likely to be attacked by rootworm adults for feeding purposes (Fig. 2). Variance analysis of adults on the silk index showed NPK treatments significant on one percent, so there had been variation between NPK fertilizer treatments. Replication was significant because of variation on each block in this index (Table1). The number of adults on the silks was different for the three nutrient treatments. There was no statistical difference between the two low doses at the 5% level of significance, however, the highest nitrogen treatment resulted in a significant difference in all cases.

Differences among the hybrids have a lower effect on the damage of corn rootworm adults and larvae than the amount of applied nitrogen. The time of silking influences the host plant preference of the emerging adults, which can be modified by the amount of applied nitrogen. The silking time of maize hybrids showed a significant correlation with increasing N fertilizer doses. Earlier silking plants become potential host plants for earlier emerging adults. Higher doses of nitrogen fertilization might increase fertility deficiencies resulting in stigma damage caused by adults. Within the effect of the corn rootworm on crop yield, larval damage is more significant, which can be influenced by the amount of applied nitrogen, since studies have confirmed that increasing the dose of nitrogen reduces the degree of damage done by the larvae and thus their negative effect on yield. In general, both larvae and adults can cause severe yield loss, but the method of control against them is different. The coincidence of the nourishment of adults and the egg-laying time with silking is a potential threat in terms of fertility. Root damage can be reduced by the time and extent of nutrient application, primarily by nitrogen fertilization. Based on the results of the experiment, further studies are required to assess the complex effects of crop years, which may facilitate more accurate modeling and prediction of pest population dynamics and damage.",
