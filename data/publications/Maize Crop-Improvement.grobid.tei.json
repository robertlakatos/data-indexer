Though it had experimental support, It did not explain how the immense diversity of the species of sect.

However, archaeobotanical studies published in 2009 now point to the lowlands of the Balsas River valley, where stone milling tools with maize residue have been found in an 8,700 years old layer of deposits. Some of the earliest pollen remains from Latin America have been found in lake sediments from tropics of southern Mexico and upper Central America, up to Laguna Martinez and have been radiocarbon dated to around 4,700 years ago. Archaeological remains of early maize ears, found at Guila Naquitz Cave in the Oaxaca Valley, date back roughly 6,250 years. The oldest ears from caves near Tehuacan, Puebla, date ca. 2750 BC. Little change occurred in ear form until ca. 1100 BC when great changes appeared in ears from Mexican caves. Maize diversity rapidly increased Perhaps as early as 1500 BC, maize began to spread widely and rapidly. As it was introduced to new cultures, new uses were developed and new varieties selected to better American, Mesoamerican, South American and Caribbean cultures. The Mesoamerican formed the Mesoamerican people's identity. During the 100 AD, maize cultivation spread from Mexico into the Southwest USA and a millennium later into Northeast USA and southeastern Canada, transforming the landscape as Native Americans cleared large forest and grassland areas for the new crop. It is unknown what precipitated its domestication, because the edible portion of the wild variety is too small and hard to obtain to be eaten directly, as each kernel is enclosed in a very hard bi-valve shell. However, George Beadle demonstrated that the kernels of teosinte are readily \"popped\" for human consumption, like modern popcorn. Some have argued that it would have taken too many generations However, studies of the hybrids readily made by intercrossing teosinte and modern maize",

          "text": "The center of origin for Zea mays has been established as the Mesoamerican region, now Mexico and Central America (Watson and Dallwitz, 1992). Archaeological records suggest that domestication of maize began at least 6000 years ago, occurring independently in regions of the southwestern United States, Mexico, and Central America (Mangelsdorf, 1974). The Portuguese introduced maize to Southeast-Asia from the America in the 16 th century. The maize was introduced into Spain after the return of Columbus from America and from Spain it went to France, Italy and Turkey. In India, Portuguese introduced maize during the seventeenth century. From India it went to China and later it was introduced in Philippines and the East Indies. Corn now is being grown in USA, China, Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, South Africa, Rumania, Yugoslavia and India. Various hypotheses have been proposed on the origin/domestication of maize (OECD, 2006). Teosintes (Z. diploperennis and Z. mays sp. mexicana) and Tripsacum species are often described as having roles in the domestication process of maize (Mangelsdorf, 1974;Galinat, 1988). An early hypothesis proposed that Z. mays sp. mexicana was the product of a natural hybridization of Tripsacum and Zea (Mangelsdorf, 1974). Further crossings of teosinte with wild maize are thought to have produced the modern races of maize. The possibility of intergeneric hybridization of either Z. diploperennis or Tripsacum with extinct wild maize has also been proposed as the ancestral origin of Z. mays (Radu et al. 1997;Purseglove, 1972). Eubanks (1993Eubanks ( , 1997a) ) suggests that domesticated maize may have arisen via human selection of natural hybrids between Tripsacum and perennial teosinte.",

However only in the Meso-American region there still exists, in situ, the original ancient maize that gave rise to improved varieties that are grown in all regions of the world. Most of the maize variation can be found in the Meso-American region and the northern part of South America. The great diversity of environments and conditions have created the basis for the development of maize varieties well adapted to harsh conditions of soil and climate as well as to biotic stresses. There is a close correlation among community culture, production system and the type of consumption Smale, 1998). There is a growing trend in developing countries to adopt improved maize varieties, primarily to meet market demand. In Mexico, only 20 % of the corn varieties grown 50 years ago remain in cultivation (World Watch Institute, 2000). The narrowing of genetic diversity in modern maize varieties emphasizes the importance of conserving genetic traits for future plant breeding. CIMMYT (International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre) has taken the lead in preserving maize germplasm. It has the world's largest collection of maize accessions, with over 17,000 lines (CIMMYT, 2000). India also harbours diverse maize germplasm (Singh, 1977;Wilkes, 1981).

The National Gene Bank at New Delhi houses about 6,000 indigenous accessions primarily from the NEH region. Systematic and comprehensive evaluation of this germplasm is being attempted. For agronomically useful traits (Prasanna et al., 2009). In addition to the races, there are several local varieties in India. The genetic variability has resulted by crossing of Indian germplasm with strains imported of Indian x Indian germplasm gave yield superiority of 24-43 %, whereas Indian x US dent germplasm out yielded local varieties by 58 % (Dhawan and Singh, 1961).

Linkage maps have been constructed to show the relative position of numerous genes on each of the 10 chromosomes. A number of genetic studies were made possible in maize because the plant is adapted to wide range of environmental conditions be done with case and simplicity. In maize crop a larger quantity of seeds can be obtained from each cob. Many easily observed hereditary characters are available in maize for study. Maize possesses many characters in recessive nature and that these can be well exposed and cross-pollination with maize which started early in the present century, have furnished the basis for Mendalian explanation of heterosis. Later studies with particular reference to economic characters, including the combining ability of inbred lines have helped to give a genetic understanding of such complex characters as vigour of growth and yielding ability",

The apex of the stem ends are suitably warm and dry, anthers on the tassel dehisce and release pollen. Maize pollen is anemophilous (dispersed by wind) and because of its large settling velocity most pollen falls within a few meters of the tassel. Each silk may become pollinated to produce one kernel of maize. Maize usually forms a single ear or cob. The silk is a collection of tubes that run from each potential grain on the ear. The pollen lands on each silk and fertilizies the grain.

Plantings for silage are even denser, and achieve a lower percentage of ears and more plant matter. Maize is a long night plant and Photoperiodicity can be eccentric in tropical cultivars, while the long days characteristic of higher latitudes allow the plants to grow so tall that they do not have enough time to produce seed before being killed by frost. These attributes, however, may prove useful in using tropical maize for biofuels.

In the United States, there is a progressive decrease in the sowing of maize from South to North at the rate of about 20 km/day. The sowing starts in late January in the South to North at the rate of about 20 of congenial temperatures, planting dates are less critical in the southern state of the USA. Optimum period is end-February to mid-March. However, if root worms are to be avoided the optimum period is in April. In India, Chele (1960) found that at Jalandhar (Pungab) the maize crop sown in the middle of July gave higher yields of grain and stalk than those sown even 10 days earlier or later. At Karim nagar (Andhra Pradesh), maize should be sown round about 24 May during kharif to get maximum yield and to escape stem-borer attack sown in January, March, April and September, while sowings in July and October would lead to average yields (Vittal Rao and Mahboob Ali, 1961). At Karnal, sowings on 1 st July consistently gave increased yield over those of sown on 15th June and 15 th July (Relwani, 1962). At Delhi, hybrid maize should be planted 10 to 15 days before onset of the monsoon to ensure good emergence and good early stand and that planting after the break of monsoon At Delhi, hybrid maize planted by 23 rd June ensures higher yields and better utilization of nitrogenous fertilizers (Shah and Sharma, 1970). At Pantnagar, sowing done on 30 th June led to increase in the number of plants with more than one cob per plant and higher yields of grain and stalk than other plantings (Sharma and Mungal, 1966). At Kanpur, sowings of open pollinated maize varieties with the break of monsoon (around 1 st July) were better than pre-monsoon (15 th June) sowings with irrigation (Pathak et al., 1971). However, highyielding hybrids and composites of maize should be planted around 22 nd May in Kulu in earlier plantings low minimum temperatures delayed the growth. The number of days variety increased with plantings from mid-May to beginning of June. However, sowings of the same after beginning of June reduced the yield (Sandhu et al., 1971). Jain (1973) has observed that optimum time of sowing of maize in various tracks, viz., 10 th April at Kalimpong (West Bengal), 23 rd May at Bilaspur (Himachal Pradesh), 25 th May at Hyderabad (Andhra Pradesh), 10 th June at Jabalpur (Madhya Pradesh), Godhra th June at Delhi and Udaipur, is about 10 to 20 days earlier than the normal onset of monsoon. Jain (1973) attributes this to the plants avoiding excess rainfall during the earlier stages of growth when they are very stage. Jain (1973) advocates that for the early summer crop planting should be completed as far as possible before mid-January but not later than the end of January to avoid the from mid October to mid -November and for rainfed crops in the hilly regions sowings from March to May recommended to get higher yields. Whether maize should be seeded prior to or after the onset of rains would depend on the soil temperature regime (Carr and Milbourn, 1976). If the soil temperature at seeding depth is the optimum range and rainfall would lower if further seeding prior to onset of rains is to be preferred. If the pre-monsoon soil temperatures are supra-optimal for germination, planting after onset of rains may be preferred. However, as yields are reduced when the vegetative growth is too quick, planting after onset of rains under sub-optimal soil temperatures or prior to the rain under supraoptimal soil temperatures may be preferred.",

Maize can also recover from hail damage if the same occurs in early stages. From the above one can state that adverse climatic conditions, if at all it is to be encountered by the crop, are better got through in the early stages. This feature explains the practice of early sowing of maize with the onset of rains, even at the risk of early drought due to late onset of regular rains. Similarly, early sowings to avoid pest and disease attacks may be resorted to even at the risk of freezing temperatures during the early crop period. Law and Cooper (1974) found that soil temperatures during the vegetative period has a bearing on the time of tasseling (Shaw and Thom, 1951) while soil moisture stress delays tasseling.

Review of work done estimating maize yields from meteorological data has been made by Leonard and Martin (1963) and Shaw (1955). The main feature that emerges is that as the maize crop is capable of recovering from early seasonal setbacks, the weather prevailing prior soil moisture stress may either act together or in opposite direction depending on the level of adequacy of the other elements under consideration. From these, Shaw (1955) concludes with 100 mm of precipitation per month in the crop growth period except the last month.",

Thus, while the hybrids were superior to the composites, which were in turn superior to the local variety, delayed sowings combined with heavy rains during silking reduced the yields of all varieties and the local yielded as much as the hybrids and composites. These investigations highlight the need for avoiding rainy weather during silking. Krishnamurthy et al. (1972) found higher dry matter production per plant in kharif season the varieties could be explained in terms of leaf-area index and the leaf-area duration.

However, CGR depended more the NAR than on LAI. Despite the advantages of the Hunt-Parsons growth analysis programme, the combined use of the classic and functional methods is recommended. Light interception reached maximum levels at LAI >3. Leaf area Grain yield of maize is mainly dependent on the number of kernels per plant that reach maturity (Cirilo and Andrade, 1994 a;Otegui et al., 1995b). This yield component is very sensitive to environmental conditions around silking (Hall et al., 1981(Hall et al., , 1982;;Kiniry and Ritchie, 1985;Westgate and Boyer, 1986).

They suggested that kernel abortion rather than morphogenetic slightly (19.5 -20.0 leaves per plant) in the experiments of Cirilo and Andrade (1994 a), positive correlations (P< 0.05) were established between kernel number per row and total leaf number (Derieux et al., 1985).

Reduction in corn yield has been shown to be directly proportional to the percentage leaf area destroyed (Hanway, 1969). The degree of yield loss caused by defoliation is dependent not only on leaf area destroyed, but also on the growth stage when defoliation occurs. Yield losses from defoliation damage are greatest during the late vegetative and reproductive stages. Although defoliation may cause lower kernel weight and test weight (Hicks et al., 1977;Tollenaar and Daynard, 1978), little information is available starch composition of corn.

Considering also the other estimates on the frequency and severity of lodging, it may be concluded that in regions where high yields are obtained the lodging damage is as great as that due to diseases and insect pests.

Intercropping maize and legumes considerably reduced the weed density compared with the monocropping maize by decrease in available light for weeds compared to monocrops (Dimitrios et al., 2010). Maize-cowpea intercropping suppresses weeds and insures against total crop failure when one crop fails (Mongi et al., 1976).

Incidentally, Bihar is the second largest maize growing state in India which grows maize in 0.58 million ha of area with a productivity of 2.6 t/ha.

As emphasized by Salunkhe and Kadam (1998), the Sweet corn kernel is built of the pedicel, the pericarp, the germ, and the parenchyma cob core (Szpaar and Dregiew, 1999). During kernel shearing, a part of the pedicel remains is attached to the cob core. The kernel is deep set on an abbreviated shoot (rachis) forming the cob, and is covered with a thin pericarp. The pericarp is a component of the seed coat tissue and forms the outer layer of the kernel. The thickness of the layer determines the kernel skin level of tenderness. This feature is important in the estimation of kernel quality for processing. As compared to other varieties, sweet corn is characterized by lower thickness a single layer of pericarp, in the cavities of which single cells of the mesocarp are located. It also includes one or two layers of cross-cells and one or more tube cells adherent to the pericarp. The germ, located obliquely at the base of the kernel, is large and constitutes about 15 % of the volume or 11.5-14 % of the weight of the kernel.

The kernel seed coat has colours from pale yellow to orange, often with a violet tint and shiny. In the genotype of sweet corn, except gene su (sugary) gene determining the sweet taste and tenderness of the kernel, also other genes have been discovered, responsible for enhancing the sweetness and the taste and utility qualities -the gene se (sugary enhancement) and the gene sh2 (shrunken 2). Genetic combinations of the genotypes su and sh2 helped in the creation of very sweet cultivars (Simonne et al., 1999). In the phase of full ripeness, sweet corn has wrinkled kernels, reserve substance of the parenchyma is composed of amylodexstrins which are responsible for the sweet taste. The kernel has a bulbous shape, oval, wedge-shaped or angular, a smooth or wrinkled surface, and white, yellow, read or brownish colouring. It is enclosed in a cover formed from fused pericarp and seed coat, beneath which there is a layer of aleurone cells, the parenchyma and the germ. From the moment of pollination till harvest the cob of sweet of sugars (Wong, 1994). With respect to the content of sugars, three types of sweet corn cultivars are distinguished: normally sweet cultivars, type su (sugary), with sugar content of 4-6 %, cultivars with increased sugar content, type se (sugary enhancement) -6-8 % and very sweet cultivars, type sh2 (shrunken 2) - 8-12 % (Warzecha, 2003). Apart from the content of sugars, fresh mass of sweet corn kernels contains 2.1-4.5% of proteins, 3-20 % of starch, 1.1-2.7 % of fats, 0.9-1.9 % of cellulose, 9-12 mg of vitamin C, small amounts of vitamins A, B1, B2, PP and mineral components such as: sodium, potassium, magnesium, et. al., 1999;Lee and McCoon, 1981). The chemical composition of the kernels is related to the weather conditions, ripeness, and method of storage (Salunkhe and Kadam, 1998). The nutritional value of sweet corn kernels is related to the content of water (72.7 %) and to the total content of solid parts (27.3 %). Solid parts include hydrocarbons (81 %), proteins (13 %), lipids (3.5 %), and others (2.5 %) (Hardenburg and Watada, 1986). Starch is the dominant hydrocarbon component. Sweet corn has higher nutritional value in the phase of milk ripeness. With progressing phase of ripeness, in the transition to the phase of wax ripeness the content of sugars decreases, accompanied by an increase in the content of starch (Suk and Sang, 1999). In 100 g of kernels there is about 3.03 g of saccharine, 0.34 g of glucose and 0.31 g of fructose. The content of saccharine increases and that of reducing sugars decreases as the kernels reach the optimum ripeness. The content of proteins in the kernels decreases from the surface towards the centre of the kernel. The content of proteins, free amino acids, water-soluble and insoluble hydrocarbons, increases up to the phase of wax ripeness and then gradually decreases (Azanza et. al., 1996). The amounts of the particular components in various cultivars and in various phases of ripeness variable. In comparison to other cereals, sweet corn is relatively rich in oil. Approximately 90 % of the oil is accumulated in the germ. Sweet corn is more tasty than other corn species to its high content of water soluble polysaccharides. That component imparts to the kernels their tender and creamy character. sweetness, texture, and taste (Wong and Swiader, 1995). Sweetness depends on the content of sugars, while texture depends on a number of factors, such as tenderness of the seed coat, moisture, content of water-soluble polysaccharides. Taste, in turn, is frequently associated with the content of DMS (dimethyl sulphide). Decrease in kernel quality related to loss of taste and aroma after the harvest is a problem for the processing industry. The loss of taste in fresh or frozen state of the kernels is caused by enzyme activity (Collins and Biles, 1996). Fresh kernels are characterized by faint aroma or its total absence. Wade (1981) states that cut kernels have three characteristic types of aroma. Two of these are similar to the aroma of fresh green vegetables, and the third is a methol-type aroma. With progressing ripeness of sweet corn, the level of DMS in the kernels decreases, which is a serious problem for the processing industry due to the related considerable loss of taste of processed sweet corn products.",

One of the most important factors determining the quality of kernels for processing is the use of cultivars characterized by but also the taste quality of the kernels. Other quality factors include the colour, sweetness, and tenderness of the kernel cover. With ripening, the cover becomes harder and harder.

It is not possible to obtain all the kernels of corn. The cutting operation severs the upper part of the kernel from the lower part, which remains on the cob. Thus, the hull of the kernel is broken open and a part of each kernel is wasted (approximately 20% remains on the cob), including much or the entire germ of the kernel. During subsequent wet-processing, including washing and blanching of the severed kernels, some of the corn meat is leached from its pouch and lost product processing characteristics. The successful detachment of sweet corn kernels as intact Szymanek (2004) showed that blanching prior to the cutting process, instead of blanching after kernel cutting, resulted in a 12% increase in yield of cut kernels and quality. However, Trongpanich et. al. (1986) reported that by delaying the time of harvest until the moisture content decreased, it is possible to increase the detached part of the kernel. Szymanek (2011) showed that the cut kernel yield increased with the increase in cutter head angular speed. The change of speed from 167.5 to 293.2 rad• s -1 increased approximately 51 % for the Jubilee variety, 29 % for the Boston variety, and 54 % for the Spirit variety. cutter head angular speed from 167.5 up to 293.2 rad• s -1 decrease of inferior kernel share. Highest reduction in inferior kernels in the investigated speed range was obtained for the Spirit variety, at about 64 %, whereas lowest was for Boston, at about 44 %. An increase in the amount of kernels cut, along with a change of a cutter head angular speed, also decreased sugar content loss. The most substantial decline in sugar losses within the studied range of cutter head speed was observed for the Jubilee variety, with about 48 %, while lower for Spirit and Boston was about 33 %.

The loss of kernels could, however, be reduced by means of the respective choice of sweet corn varieties. Robertson et al. (1980) think that solutions to this problem are being developed by food engineers and plant breeders by modifying the mechanical separation method and by modifying the raw product processing characteristics. However, claims that reduction of the kernel moisture could be achieved by delaying the cob harvesting dates, which, in turn, reduces loss during the kernel cutting process. In addition, blanching the cobs prior to attempting the cutting process (Stewart et al., 1997) and selecting the optimum operation The method proposed by Robertson and Farkas (1982), whereby the cobs are halved along their length and the kernel is subsequently detached on reciprocally moving conveyor belts consumes too much energy and has not so far been applied on industrial scale. In recent years, the growing concern about applying freezing methods, including cryo-liquids, in the products, including sweet corn (frozen cobs or kernel). In highly technologically advanced countries, about 30 % (20 % in Poland) of the production output of sweet corn is designated for freezing and about 40 % for canned food (60 % in Poland) (Waligóra, 2006). Freezing temperatures and consequently very short freezing times. Unlike in classic (slow) freezing, the cryo-liquid freezing method results in a high quality of the product processed.

This might be due to lack of uniformity in kernels freezing which this method is the reduction of waste and increased yield of corn. During the analyses of kernels separation (Szymanek, 2011), 86.3 % of intact kernels removed after 2 and 4 minutes of freezing contained adhering cob related tissue, and 13.7 % of kernels were without such tissue. However, for intact kernel freezing for 6, 8 and 10 minutes, the relations were opposite only the quantity but also the quality. Robertson et al.

In the range from 2 to 10 minutes were observed the decrease of kernels damage from 7.3 to 3.9 %. The share of damaged kernels showed the same tendency as changes of kernels separation rate. The proportions time might be due to increasing of hardness of whole kernels which results in kernels being more resistant to mechanical action of shelling unit. The mechanism of damages formation can be compared to threshing dried cob. Nguyen (1986) reported that when shelling dried cob, only the linkage between kernel and corn cob is broken. When threshing fresh cob, we have to break down two linkages: kernel -corn cob and kernel -kernel. This causes a considerable amount of broken kernels.

Damage is critical when the growing points of young plants are completely damaged when there is extensive lodging due to stem boring and when second and third generation larvae feed directly on the cob. Yield loss as high as 40 % has been attributed to stem borers. Adult moths generally have dark brown, patterned forewings and white to grey-brown hind wings. In wet, cold conditions adult moths develop darker colouring. Adult moths are nocturnal and have a wing span of 25 to 40 mm. Females are generally slightly larger than males. Females usually mate on the night of emergence and will lay on the subsequent 3 to 4 nights. Females lay eggs in batches of 100 to 200. Each female can lay up to 1000 eggs in a life time. Adults have an area of dispersal of up to 1.6 km and occasionally further. Eggs are light yellow in colour, spherical and approximately 1 mm in diameter. Eggs are laid in a single column on the stem under leaf sheaths. Eggs hatch in about 10 days. Young larvae are generally dark brown, purple or black in colour. They migrate to the whorl to feed. There are usually 6 larval instars although 8 are possible in unfavorable conditions. Larvae mature in about 35 days and pupate in the stem. Prior to pupating, larvae cut a small hold in the stem which enables the adult moth to emerge. Pupae are generally 25 mm in length and shiny yellow brown to dark brown in colour. Males are usually smaller than females. Pupae are found in galleries within the stem. The pupae stage lasts from 2 to 3 weeks. In favorable conditions, the life cycle can take 7 or 8 weeks.

Boring damage on the ears can also make them vulnerable to fungal infection. The signs are horizontal rows of perforations in young leaves, stunted plants, lodging and patchy plant stand, excessive frass (faeces) in the collar of the plant. Female moths are pale yellow to light brown in colour with a wing ranging from 25 to 35 mm. Male moths are usually slightly darker and smaller with a wing of 20 to 25 mm. Adult moths are nocturnal and remain motionless in border vegetation during the day. Adult longevity ranges from 18 to 24 days.

The pathogen is Puccinia polysora. Urediospores of Polysora rust are clearly ovoid (20-29 x 29-40μm) and golden in colour. Urediospores of P. polysora are also characterised by fewer spines and teliospores of P. polysora are not known to germinate. P. polysora is not known to have an alternative host on which the sexual stage of the life cycle is completed. The optimal temperature for humidity favor Polysora rust. Urediospores are the primary source of inoculum both at the start and during the growing season. Continuous maize cultivation and presence of infected crop debris at the onset of subsequent seasons will result in large levels of initial disease inoculum. Urediospores are wind dispersed.",

However, the two can be distinguished, as pustules of Polysora rust occur predominantly on the upper leaf surface, whereas pustules of common rust occur abundantly on both leaf surfaces. Pustules (uredinia) are orangish in colour, circular (0.2 to 2 mm long), raised and most prominent on the leaf, but also occur on the stems and sheaths. When the pustules rupture, urediospores are released, resulting in the secondary cycles of the disease, giving the leaves a rusty appearance. Towards plant maturity, pustules become dark brown to black and release teliospores. Pustules that release teliospores are known as telia. Under severe disease pressure, leaves can turn chlorotic and senesce prematurely. Rupturing of pustules results in release of powdery brown urediospores. Under favorable disease conditions, Polysora rust can spread rapidly. Spores remain viable even when disseminated vast distances in excess of hundreds of kilometres. This disease is known to infect maize, plume grasses, gama grasses and teosinthe. Resistant management. Fungicides should be applied while there is a limited amount of secondary inoculum. Cultivate early maturing varieties which limit secondary cycles of the disease. Planting early can avoid periods of heavy disease pressure later in the season.

Each basidium germinates into several haploid basidiospores which bud in a similar fashion to yeast cells, forming haploid sporidia of opposing mating types (+ and -). Mating types are generally produced in equal numbers. Sporidia of opposing mating types fuse to produce dikaryotic hyphae that are infectious to maize seedlings. Infective mycelium invades the meristemic once the plant reaches the reproductive growth stages. Head smut is predominantly a soil borne disease. Seed borne inoculum has been documented but is not considered important. Resistant varieties are available and should be cultivated in regions where head smut is a problem. As teliospores can survive for several years in the soil, crop rotation is of limited use. Planting maize during seasons that are unfavourable to teliospore germination will reduce infection. Ensuring that the soil is well-fertilized can reduce disease severity. Removing and destroying sori before they rupture can limit the spread of inoculum. Seed treatment with f.

Diplodia maydis) prevalent in cool, humid temperate regions whereas Stenocarpella macrospora (syn. Diplodia macrospora) prevalent in warm, humid regions. Symptoms of this disease apparent after silking. It causes browning of the pith of the basal internodes of the maize plant. Oval, elongate lesions (up to 10 cm long) with pale cream-brown centers and dark brown borders often form on infected stalk tissue. Leaves wilt suddenly and become grayish-green. The pith in infected stalk tissue becomes discoloured and weakened and the crop stand is characterized by lodging. This stalk rot forms abundant, (spherical with circular protruding papillate ostiole) and multicellular. Pycnidia are 150-450 μm in diameter while the ostiole is typically 30-40 μm in diameter.

Corn in the full dent stage produces 50 % more feed than in the milk stage and 100 % more feed than in the silking stage. Corn harvested in the milk or silking stage results in poorer quality silage because of its high moisture content. One of the most important steps in producing quality maize silage is to harvest at the proper moisture. The storage structure determines the proper moisture level at which to harvest. Desired moisture levels to 70 %. Upright silos are 62 to 68 %. Trench silos are 65 to 70 %. Ideally, moisture levels in the silage should be monitored at harvest to prevent harvesting the crop outside the desired range. If moisture testing is not feasible, then estimate the crop moisture by the stage of crop development. At Islamabad (Pakistan), higher crude protein values were found in leaves as compared to other portions. Younger plants contained more crude protein as compared to the matured % with maximum values in the bottom portion of the stem. Matured plants contained more Kernel milk line can serve as an indicator of whole plant moisture levels. As kernels deposited in the crown (outer) area of the kernel and milk occupies the basal area of the kernel. This appears as a whitish line separating the two areas.

When forage is put into a sealed container such as a pit covered with plastic, a drum or a plastic bag, the container is called a silo. A silo has to be completely sealed against air and the forage material must be chopped and compressed in the silo to ensure the fast development of anaerobic conditions and a rapid fall in pH. In these conditions, lactic acid bacteria, which convert some of the sugars in the plant into the pleasant tasting lactic acid, prevail over undesirable bacterial such as clostridia which produce butyric acid, which is unpalatable to livestock, and moulds, which cause rotting of the silage.

In general, corn stover is about 38 % cellulose, 26 % hemicellulose and 19 % lignin. Maize stover, therefore, contains low levels of crude protein content and high levels of indigestible carbohydrates such as lignin. Maize stover possesses very little moisture ranging from 9-12 per cent. Lignin is structural carbohydrate which is almost indigestible to ruminants. Compared to wheat straw maize stover contain more protein, but higher lignin content. This is perhaps the reason why wheat straw is considered more popular as animal fodder compared to maize stover. quantities of protein and palatability. The quality of maize declines with maturity.

Seed priming has presented promising and even surprising results, for many seeds including the cereal seeds (Bradford, 1986a). The few studies on maize are not overemphasized and are encouraging, but more information is required before its use as a routine practice in seed technology.

They feature a large hopper that feeds the uniformly sized maize for the production of ethanol fuel. Ethanol is mixed with gasoline in order to decrease the amount of pollutants emitted when used to fuel motor vehicles. High fuel prices in mid 2007 led to higher demand for ethanol, which in turn lead to higher prices paid to farmers for history for farmers. Because of the relationship between fuel and maize, prices paid for the crop now tend to track the price of oil. Maize is widely used in Germany as a feedstock for biogas plants.

The latest innovation in the industry is the twin extruder. The two rotating screws clean as they rotate. This allows the dough to move more smoothly than in an extruder with only one screw. By using a twin-screw extruder, along with computers to precisely control temperature and pressure, cereals that usually require about 24 hours to make may be made in as little as 20 minutes. The corn grains after cleaning and polishing are milled to remove the germ and bran. Germ is utilised for extraction of corn oil. The bran is cooked under pressure in rotary steam out to a uniform translucent colour. The cooked material is carried to an agitator or lump is kept in tempering tanks for few hours to permit the residual moisture to become equally distributed which is known as sweating.

Previously, vendors popped that drove a small engine which drove the gears, shaft and agitator that stirred the corn and powered the attention-attracting clown -the Toasty Roasty Man.

The amount of this alcohol soluble protein fraction zein is low in immature maize. They increase as the grain matures. Zein is very low in lysine and tryptophan content. Since this fraction contributes more than 50 % of the total protein, due to this obvious reason the protein of normal maize grain is low in lysine and tryptophan content. On the other hand, zein fractions contain very high amount of leucine and imbalanced proportion of isoleucine (Patterson et al., 1980). On the whole, the ill proportion of all these four essential amino acids in maize due the high content of zein results into the poor quality of protein in normal maize. The high quality of protein in other fractions in other parts of maize kernel becomes recessive due to the dominance of zein in normal maize. The poor quality of protein in It was realized to improve the biological value of protein in maize genotypes. For this purpose, a new corn type known as QPM was developed by lowering the concentration of zein by 30 %. As a result, the concentration of two essential amino acids viz., lysine and tryptophan in grain was increased in QPM genotypes as compared to normal grain maize genotypes. The lower content of leucine in QPM further balances the ratio of leucine to isoleucine content (It is compositing 250 open pollinated cases of various trials of KH 1977.

These selections have narrowed the yield gap between high-oil corn and normal corn hybrids, though in general high-oil corn hybrids yield 5-10 % lower than normal corn. The corn germ consists of scutellum and embryo. The embryo contains primary axis, plumule, coleoptile, mesocotyl, adventitious and primary roots and the coleorhiza. The scutellum in normal corn makes up about 10-12 % of total kernel weight but it contains 83-85 % of total kernel oil. Pericarp tip cap and endosperm contain 10-13 % of total oil. The scutellum consists of epithelial parenchyma cells and vascular tissues. Oil synthesis takes place in developing scutellum tissue deposits, oil bodies or spherosomes in the parenchyma cells of the scutellum. Immediately after pollination kernel development starts very fast with higher rate of endosperm development as compared to germ. Within 15 days after pollination (DAP) oil can be detected in developing embryos and it continues to increase till 45 DAP and then remains constant to physiological maturity or black layer stage.
