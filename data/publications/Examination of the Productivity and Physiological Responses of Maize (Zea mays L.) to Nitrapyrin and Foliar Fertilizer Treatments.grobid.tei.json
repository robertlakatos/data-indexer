Nitrapyrin, as a nitrification inhibitor-which reduces nitrogen loss-and foliar fertilizer treatments have been successfully used to enhance the efficiency of nutrient utilization, however, the impacts of these two technologies on physiological development, enzymatic responses, and productivity of maize are poorly studied. In this paper, the concentration of each stress indicator, such as contents of proline, malondialdehyde (MDA), relative chlorophyll, photosynthetic pigments, and the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) were measured in maize leaf tissues. In addition, biomass growth, as well as quantitative and qualitative parameters of yield production were examined. Results confirm the enhancing impact of nitrapyrin on the nitrogen use of maize. Furthermore, lower activity of proline, MDA, SOD, as well as higher photosynthetic activity were shown in maize with a more favorable nutrient supply due to nitrapyrin and foliar fertilizer treatments. The obtained findings draw attention to the future practical relevance of these technologies that can be implemented to enhance the physiological development and productivity of maize. However, this paper also highlights the importance of irrigation, as nutrient uptake from soil by the crops decreases during periods of drought.",

Considering N losses, N fertilizers are ideal to be applied at later stages of maize development, when the efficiency of the absorption and the use of N by the plant increases . Although maize requires substantial N input, it has been shown that excessive N fertilization does not increase yield, but it contributes to increased N loss . As prior studies have already revealed, substantial N loss results mainly from nitrate (NO 3 -) leaching from the soil surface  which contaminates the quality of groundwater . Thus, it is struggling to ensure optimal N fertilizer for crops that must be under strict environmental regulations. Additionally, the utilization of N is affected by the weather. Heavy rainfalls or higher temperatures heighten the risk of losing N from leaching or volatilization, posing a challenge to growers deciding on the amount of N to be applied .",

Foliar fertilization of arable crops has not been a part of everyday practice , and it has been used traditionally to make up for nutrient deficiencies . However, weather extremities-such as heat stress and drought-and the limited availability of micronutrients in the soils prompted farmers to provide extra support to crops by supplementing soil fertilization . Particularly strong need for foliar feeding emerges during soil water stress when nutrient uptake becomes energetically unfavorable for each plant , as well as during periods of rapid growth . However, it must be noted that foliar fertilization can be used merely as a supplemental method and does not replace fertilization of the soil with the major nutrients . As many prior studies have confirmed, foliar fertilizer treatments can improve nutrient use efficiency, heal nutrient deficiency, mitigate the harmful effects of stress on crops , and enhance photosynthetic activity.

Considering plant physiology, one of the greatest damages is caused by cell damage due to the peroxidation of lipids on cell membranes . To mitigate such adverse conditions, crops have evolved an antioxidant defense system which also allows the analytical study of the effects of environmental factors through the activity of the enzymatic elements of this system . Insufficient N supply (both excess and low rate) as an abiotic stressor triggers the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), resulting in oxidative stress in crops. In addition, excessive ROS can react with key photosynthetic substances processing chlorophyll degradation . The first-line defense against ROS accumulated in plant cells due to damaging oxidative stress effects is provided by, inter alia, metal-containing superoxide dismutase (SOD). Its increased level due to stress helps to neutralize reactive oxygen species , thus reducing adverse effects in crops . It has been revealed that the activities and expression of antioxidant enzymes such as SOD are strongly linked to N supply  as it is significantly increased with N fertilization up to a certain range . This phenomenon is consistent with a study on nitrapyrin-which aims to optimize N utilization-that increases in the photosynthetic activity by providing more N and enhanced activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) were observed in waterlogged maize . In addition, the accumulation of proline as a \"stress amino acid\" in plant cells is a widespread response to adverse (especially water deficiency and excessive salt concentration) environmental factors . Although the increased N supply of maize by adding nitrapyrin to N fertilizer does not directly influence the content of proline in leaf tissues , maize with an improved condition resulting from enhanced N and other nutrients supply is likely to be more tolerant to abiotic stress.",

The authors believe that all plants that have not been treated with a combination of the two technologies will develop nutrient stress due to their poorer nutrient supply. To monitor the efficiency of nitrapyrin, nitrate content was measured regularly in the soil. In this present research, the stress response to different nutrition of maize was studied by measuring the contents of proline, the rate of lipid peroxidation, relative chlorophyll, and photosynthetic pigments (chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and carotenoids), as well as the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD). Since foliar feeding is attracting renewed attention due to global warming, and nitrapyrin has gained considerable interest in the practical use, we believe this study advances in the knowledge of the effect of these two technologies on stress adaptation of maize studied enzymatically, which was unprecedented before, thereby obtaining encouraging results.",

Similar results were obtained in the second stage measured at stage R1, however, the joint treatment (NP + FF) resulted in the highest SPAD readings in the leaves. In summary, the increase in relative chlorophyll content was mainly influenced by nitrapyrin (NP) (Figure 2). By examining the concentration of the individual photosynthetic pigments (chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, carotenoid) in leaf tissues, it was found that, at stage V12, only the nitrapyrin treatment (NP) contributed to a significant increase of chlorophyll a (Chl a), while chlorophyll b (Chl b) was not influenced by any of the treatments. In the case of the ratio of Chl a to Chl b, there was a minor, but not a major difference between the treatments. At the V12 stage, carotenoid (Car) contents were not affected by any treatment.

Although the results obtained in stage R1 suggest that the difference between the three treatments (NP, FF, NP + FF) is moderated, the MDA concentration in the control (CT) maize remained significantly higher (Figure 3). As regards the SOD activity, results obtained at the V12 stage already revealed a highly significant increase in the SOD activity level in untreated (CT) cultivars, which was reduced in all other treatments (NP, FF, NP + FF). At the R1 stage, all treatments (NP, FF, NP + FF) resulted in a decrease in SOD activity. However, the best results were obtained by the joint treatment of nitrapyrin and foliar fertilizer (NP + FF) (Figure 4). Regarding the proline content, the results obtained at the V12 stage revealed that the highest proline content was achieved in the untreated (CT) maize which decreased in all other treatments (NP, FF, NP + FF). The proline content was the lowest due to foliar fertilization (FF) treatment and the joint application of nitrapyrin and foliar fertilizer (NP + FF), however, no significant difference was observed between the two. Results obtained at the R1 stage show a similar tendency as the three treatments (NP, FF, NP + FF) contributed to the substantial decrease of proline content.

However, N content slightly increased in maize treated with both nitrapyrin and foliar fertilizer (NP + FF), which can be explained by the extra N content that was applied in the form of foliar fertilization (80 mg L -1 ). Although many of the nutrients were below the critical level (N, P, K, S), a slight increase was observed in maize treated with NP + FF. At the same time, the authors are convinced that, due to lack of precipitation resulting from the adverse weather conditions, these nutrients could not be adequately utilized by the crops (only 3.4 mm precipitation fell on the ninth week after maize sowing when leaf samples were collected; Figure 6). For this reason, attention is also drawn to the adverse effects of climate change, as the nutrient use efficiency of maize decreases under non-irrigated conditions or during periods of drought [47].",

This result is consistent with previous studies which outlined that nitrapyrin started to become less effective when soil temperature elevated, as a result of decomposition leading to a reduction in the inhibition on nitrification . A study by Touchton et al. published in 1979 -not long after its first report of nitrapyrin in 1962 by Goring -already highlighted that the application of nitrapyrin is not recommended when the soil temperature is above 13 • C, otherwise, it will result in unsatisfactory nitrification control. A similar result was published in a recent study by Byrne et al. (2020)  which stated that nitrapyrin is stable and persistent only in cool soils, but it goes under chemical hydrolysis in warmer soils within 30 days. The obtained findings are of direct practical relevance, i.e., nitrapyrin is advisable to be applied in the autumn season on colder soils to mitigate N loss, as the soil temperature-as an interacting factor-largely determines nitrapyrin's mode of action . In contrast, some previous studies found that spring-applied nitrapyrin effectively reduces N loss during wet vegetation as well . Furthermore, Pittelkow et al. (2017)  reported the inefficiency of fall-applied nitrapyrin. At this point, the uneven precipitation distribution in this present experiment needs to be pointed out. The efficiency of nitrapyrin started to decline not only when the soil temperature rose, but also when sufficient precipitation was lacking, as well as in the time of drought. The authors' observation is in correspondence with several studies which have shown that nitrapyrin sufficiently decreased N loss in the waterlogged field where nitrate leaching is a substantial source of N loss . In our research, due to frequent precipitation, nitrate leaching has increased in the untreated soil causing lower nitrate content. Conversely, in the nitrapyrin-treated soil, despite the regular rainfall, nitrapyrin contributed to retaining more N. In other words, the amount of nitrate leached from the untreated soil by rainfalls could be utilized by the crops from the nitrapyrin-treated soil. Thus, based on the authors' assumptions, the effect of nitrapyrin would have been prolonged if there had been abundant rainfall.",

Several prior studies have already supported the authors' findings as nitrapyrin increases plant chlorophyll by providing nutrients and increasing photosynthesis capacity; therefore, it increases leaf SPAD values which indicate the N status of maize . It is commonly known that the photosynthetic activity of maize is closely linked to its general health conditions . For this reason, it was not a surprise that the highest SPAD values at the R1 stage were obtained in maize co-treated with nitrapyrin and foliar fertilizer (NP + FF). Lu et al. (2001)  also reported that insufficient N supply reduces photosynthesis. However, it is worth noting that data obtained in the present research show that cultivars treated with foliar fertilizer alone (FF) only slightly increased their SPAD values. A study by Ling et al. (2002)  can be an explanation for this finding, as their results suggest that foliar fertilization is only a supplemental method that may correct nutrient deficiencies but cannot replace soil-applied fertilizers of major nutrients. Thus, as chlorophyll molecules contain N , it can be concluded that the increase of the relative chlorophyll content was mainly due to more favorable N conditions in the soil provided by nitrapyrin (NP).",

However, at the R1 stage, the joint treatment of nitrapyrin and foliar fertilizer resulted in higher Car content, which suggests that the joint treatment of nitrapyrin and foliar fertilization (which also contained N) may have resulted in the best N supply conditions for maize, thereby increasing Car content Furthermore, in a study by Tóth et al.

In the present research, nitrapyrin (NP) and foliar fertilizer (FF), and the combination of the two (NP + FF) prevented lipid peroxidation by reducing the MDA concentration in the leaves compared to the untreated cultivars (CT) at both sampling times. Nitrapyrin likely contributed to more favorable conditions of maize by providing more available N forms in the soil. As a consequence, the lack of N in untreated maize (CT) resulted in oxidative stress, increasing MDA concentration. The obtained results were confirmed in a recent study by Li et al.

As reported by Jiang et al. (2005) , the increase of the applied N mitigates the rate of lipid peroxidation. Moreover, N fertilizer has a significant effect on the degree of lipid peroxidation . A study on the efficiency of nitrapyrin also supports the obtained results, as it contributed to mitigating (waterlogging) damages on the antioxidant system by increasing the activities of protective system enzymes and decreasing the MDA concentration . In this present experiment, foliar fertilization rich in N was also conductive to alleviating stress in maize, suggesting that fertilized plants were less affected by environmental stresses .

The obtained results showed that the better N supply reduced the SOD activity, which has been confirmed by prior studies on how the activity of SOD is affected under different N supply forms of maize. Yue et al. (2021)  found that excessive N fertilization (200 and 300 kg ha -1 ) increased substantially the SOD activity, while Yang et al.

Foliar feeding (FF) also improved the stress tolerance of maize, as SOD decreased compared to non-foliar fertilized cultivars (CT). This finding was likely because other nutrients such as iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), and manganese (Mn) also play a key role as cofactors in the structure of many antioxidant enzymes . These cofactors are required by SOD for effective ROS detoxification . Thus, the lack of these elements contributes to the lower activity of the antioxidant enzymes, imposing increased sensitivity to environmental stresses .

Moreover, a study in 1979 by Göring et al.  already reported that proline also accumulates under nutrient deficiency such as N. Tarighaleslami et al.

This agrees with the results of this study concerning untreated maize (CT) and thus, N poor cultivars showed a higher level of proline in leaf tissues compared to the nitrapyrin-treated (NP) cultivars. Since studies on the effects of other microelements on proline accumulation are lacking presumably due to an irrelevant relationship between the two, it can be concluded that both nitrapyrin and nitrogenous foliar fertilizer improved the N supply of treated crops, creating more favorable conditions of stress control.",

Irrigation should be indispensable for the enhanced nutrient utilization from the soil, as uneven rainfalls and prolonged droughts are to be expected in the future. For this reason, this issue needs further investigation.",

All data were obtained in 2021. The field experiment represents four treatments (control: CT; nitrapyrin: NP; foliar fertilizer: FF; nitrapyrin + foliar fertilizer: NP + FF) which were repeated five times (randomized block design) in fodder maize (Zea mays L., FAO 490, Kite Zrt.). Nitrapyrin (N-Lock TM Max, Corteva Agriscience, Wilmington, DE, USA) was sprayed (22 April; 1.7 L ha -1 ; in 300 L water ha -1 ) before maize sowing (27 April) and it was immediately incorporated into the soil (6-8 cm depth). Furthermore, its application was adapted to the incoming precipitation. Four mm rain fell within a few hours after spraying, and a further 12 mm precipitation within two weeks helped to activate the soil-applied nitrapyrin. Foliar fertilizer (10 L ha -1 ; in 300 L water ha -1 ) was applied on 23 June, at the stage of V9-V10 (BBCH 19), when maize had sufficient leaf area to absorb nutrients. The nutrient composition of foliar fertilizer is presented in Parameters of maize yield. Data represent mean ± SD (n = 10); Chl: chlorophyll; Car: carotenoids; CT: untreated control; NP: nitrapyrin; FF: foliar fertilizer; NP + FF: joint treatment of nitrapyrin and foliar fertilizer, FW: fresh weight. Different lowercase letters denote significant differences (one-way ANOVA and Duncan's multiple range test, p ≤ 0.05) between the different treatments. Samples of the top fully expanded maize leaves were taken on two occasions (at stage V12, 11th week after sowing, 6 July; and maize silking (R1), 2 August 14th week after sowing) to examine the stress response of maize to different nutrient supplies resulting from nitrapyrin and foliar fertilizer treatments. These two stages were chosen because both periods are critical stages in maize development. At the V12 stage, the potential number of kernels on each ear and the ear size (length) were determined. Nutrients are critical during this period as maize is in a rapid growth phase. In addition, as a result of nutrient or water stress, the largest yield reduction occurred at the R1 stage (silking) [93], which is a part of the reproductive stages.",

Measurements were taken using a WxPRO™ weather station (Campbell Scientific, Shepshed, UK). Data of soil temperature was collected with an SM150T soil moisture sensor (Delta-T Devices, Cambridge, UK). Although spring brought abundant rainfall which moistened the soils, even mid-April did not provide the proper conditions for timely maize sowing (27 April) due to the slow rise in temperature and frosts. Initial maize development was delayed and soils were wet for a prolonged period. There was enough precipitation to cover the water needs of maize (74 mm) until the fifth week after maize sowing. However, the temperature was still unusually low (average 14.7 • C). During the subsequent period, an extremely uneven distribution of precipitation coupled with extremely high temperatures was measured. Effects of global warming were experienced which manifested in weather extremities (heat stress, persistent drought, atmospheric aridity, hails, sudden floods). Overall, maize crops had to cope with extreme challenges, and heat-stressed maize showed the symptoms of rolling and water deficiency. Data for precipitation and air temperatures during the sampling period are shown in Figure 6.",

Samples were taken from nitrapyrin-free (CT, FF) blocks and nitrapyrin-treated (NP, NP + FF) blocks (six samples per treatment). In terms of nitrate changes in the soil, foliar fertilizer (FF) itself has no relevance because the amount of liquid that may leak into the soil is negligible. Foliar fertilization provides only a supplemental fertilization strategy that delivers nutrients directly to the above-ground plant organs . Therefore, the foliar application must require sufficient leaf area to become effective . Samplings were performed 7 times, approximately every 2-3 weeks, adapted to the prevailing weather conditions.

For root sampling, to avoid bias due to the different sample sizes, 30 cm 3 of soil was dug out from the surface and root samples (10 roots per treatment) were cleaned from soil residues and dried at 60 • C until constant weight. As a next step, the weight of clean and dried root samples was measured. Stem diameter (20 per treatment) was measured using a caliper above the three lowest nodes.
