          "text": "The objectives of this study were to determine how the distribution of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) in a maize canopy affected basal internode strength and stalk lodging. The distributions of PAR within the canopies of two maize cultivars (Zhongdan 909 and Xinyu 41) were altered by removing whole leaves or half leaves in different canopy layers. The results showed that removing whole leaves or half leaves above the three-ear-leaves (R AE and R AE/2 ) at flowering significantly increased PAR at the ear and interception of PAR (IPAR) from the ear to middle of the ear and soil surface. These changes increased the structural carbohydrate content and rind penetration strength (RPS) of the third basal internode by 5.4-11.6% and reduced lodging by 4.2-7.8%. Removal of the first three leaves below the three-ear-leaves (R BE ) before flowering significantly reduced IPAR from the ear to half way below the ear. This reduced the structural carbohydrate content and the RPS of the third basal internode by 9.1-17.4% and increased lodging by 7.0-11.2%. Removal of the three lowest green leaves (R B ) in the canopy before flowering increased PAR at the bottom of the canopy, but had no effect on the structural carbohydrate content of the basal internode, the RPS, and the lodging rate. Overall, the results indicated that the key factors affecting the basal internode strength formation and lodging were PAR at the ear and IPAR from the ear to halfway below the ear. Increasing PAR at the ear and IPAR from the ear to halfway below the ear could enhance lodging resistance by increasing the structural carbohydrate content and mechanical strength of the basal internode.",

          "text": "High plant density is one means of increasing maize yield (Chen et al. 2012;Ittersum and Cassman 2013). However, (i.e., breakage) occurs at the third or fourth basal internode (Gou et al. 2008(Gou et al. , 2010)). Plant breeders have generally tried to improve lodging resistance by increasing stalk strength (Zuber et al. 1980;Flint-Gatcia et al. 2003). The strength of maize stalks comes primarily from the rind (i.e., the outer portion of the stalk). Rind penetration strength (RPS) is the force required to puncture the rind with the needle of a rind penetrometer (Sibale et al. 1992;Martin et al. 2004). Several studies have indicated that RPS is significantly and negatively correlated with stalk lodging (Jampatong et al. 2000;Gou et al. 2007). Martin et al. (2004) reported that stalk lodging decreased proportionally as RPS increased. Previous studies showed that basal internodes acted as levers which held plants upright, thereby playing an important role in stalk breakage (Yuan et al. 2002;Martin et al. 2004;Gou et al. 2007). Therefore, greater mechanical strength at the basal internodes is important for improving maize lodging resistance.",

          "text": "Close planting increases light competition among individual plants (Pagano and Maddonni 2007). Generally, close planting of maize increases the leaf area index (LAI) and mutual shading among individual leaves. This shading significantly reduces photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) in the mid and lower canopy layers from the mid-vegetative to early grain-filling stages (Tollenaar and Aguilera 1992;Maddonni and Otegui 2004). Moreover, photosynthetic capacity decreases when leaves are either shaded or under weak light conditions because of changes in plant morphology, light capture, photosynthetic electron transport, and levels of enzymes related to carbon assimilation (Li et al. 2014;Marchiori et al. 2014). Carbohydrate accumulation and partitioning in the basal internode decline as the photosynthetic capacity of leaves in the lower canopy decreases.",

          "text": "Maize leaves can develop excessively as plant competition increases at high plant density. That diverts energy and nutrients from grain production (Hao et al. 2010). High plant density also reduces light intensity at the ear layer (Tollenaar and Aguilera 1992). All of the above changes can cause maize grain yields to decline. The partial removal of leaves is one possible way to increase light intensity in closely planted canopies. That could raise energy use efficiency, retard leaf senescence and increase grain yield (Liu et al. 2013). Liu et al. (2009) reported that when maize plant density was 10.0 plants m -2 , their yields were significantly greater when LAI was reduced from 8.2 to 5.5 by leaf removal. Echarte et al. (2006) reported that when maize plant density was 8.0 to 9.0 plants m -2 , the removal of three or four leaves reduced canopy LAI. That caused a 30% decrease in light interception. The changes in canopy structure due to leaf removal affect not only grain yield, but also dry matter partitioning in stalks. Edmeades and Lafitte (1993) reported that when maize plant density was 10.0 plants m -2 , stalk weight increased when all but the five leaves closest to the ear were removed. Similarly, Liu et al. (2015) observed that at 10.0 plants m -2 , removal of the four uppermost maize leaves increased stalk weight by 12%. Removal of the six uppermost leaves increased stalk weight by 20%. However, the authors also reported that removal of the upper leaves reduced grain yield. That indicated that decreasing the LAI of closely planted maize increased light intensity in the canopy and the photosynthetic capacity of the leaves. Those changes not only increased stalk dry matter accumulation and stalk lodging resistance, but also grain yield. However, it is not yet known which canopy layer contributes most to carbohydrate accumulation and mechanical strength formation in the basal internode.",

Previous studies indicate that LAI is negatively correlated with light intensity in maize canopies; however, LAI is positively correlated with IPAR (Maddonni et al. 2001;Stewart et al. 2003). Under natural conditions, light intensity gradually decreases from top to bottom in maize canopies. The upper canopy intercepts more PAR than the lower canopy. In this study, removing all or half leaves above the ear (R AE and R AE/2 ) reduced LAI above the ear and caused IPAR above the ear to decline. This allowed more PAR transmission into the mid and lower canopy layers. Overall, removing leaves above the ear increased PAR in each canopy layer and increased IPAR below the ear (Fig. 2). The largest increase in PAR was in the ear layer (Vertical distribution of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) as affected by leaf removal at flowering). Removing three leaves below the three-ear-leaves (R BE ) had no effect on PAR in the upper canopy, but it reduced LAI in the H 3 -H 2 layer and caused IPAR in the H 3 -H 2 layer to decline. This allowed more PAR transmission into the H 3 -H 2 and H 2 -H 1 layers. The R BE treatment reduced IPAR in the H 3 -H 2 layer and increased PAR in the H 3 -H 2 and H 2 -H 1 layers. Removal of three lowest green leaves (R B ) increased PAR, but reduced IPAR in the H 2 -H 1 layer. The other canopy layers were not affected by the removal of the three lowest leaves. In summary, removing upper leaves influenced PAR distribution in the entire canopy; however, removing lower leaves only affected PAR distribution in the lower canopy layer.",

          "text": "Photosynthetically active radiation drives plant photosynthesis and dry matter accumulation. Plant dry matter  accumulation is significantly and positively correlated with IPAR (Kiniry et al. 2004;Edwards et al. 2007). Changes in PAR and IPAR inevitably lead to changes in the photosynthetic capacity of maize leaves and dry matter accumulation. It has been reported that leaves below the ear are the main source of photosynthates for vegetative organs (stalk, young leaves) of maize (Maddonni and Otegui 2004). Therefore, declines in IPAR in the lower canopy may result in less dry matter accumulation at the basal internode and a decrease in the thickness of both the internode rind and the mechanical tissue in the stalk (Kaack et al. 2003;Yao et al. 2013). Our results showed that removing leaves above the three-ear-leaves increased PAR in the ear layer and IPAR in the lower canopy. Those changes increased total carbohydrate content, structural carbohydrate content and RPS of the third internode (Carbohydrate content of the third internode as affected by leaf removal treatments and Fig. 4). In contrast, removing the first three leaves below the three-ear-leaves (R BE ) reduced IPAR below the ear as well as dry matter accumulation, which caused a decrease in total carbohydrate content, structural carbohydrate content and RPS and an increase in lodging rate. Comparing the four leaf removal treatments, RPS was high when three leaves below the ear were not removed (R AE , R AE/2 and R B ). Removal of the three leaves below the ear (R BE ) significantly decreased the RPS of the third basal internode. Therefore, leaves from the ear to half way below the ear (H 3 -H 2 layer) played a very important role in determining the mechanical strength of the third basal internode and lodging resistance.",

          "text": "The third internode is located in the H 2 -H 1 layer. Matter and energy assimilated by leaves in the H 2 -H 1 layer are mainly used for the growth of new internode and leaves. The leaf area gradually increases from the bottom of the canopy to the ear. Thus leaves in the H 3 -H 2 layer assimilate more matter and energy than leaves in the H 2 -H 1 layer. Carbohydrates assimilated by leaves in the H 3 -H 2 layer are translocated not only to new leaves and internodes but also to lower internodes. This results in the synthesis of structural carbohydrates and the thickening of the internode rind. Increased translocation of photosynthates to the third internode can improve its mechanical strength. Therefore, leaves in H 3 -H 2 layer are the main source of matter and energy for structural carbohydrates accumulation and mechanical strength formation. It can be deduced that PAR at the ear and IPAR in the H 3 -H 2 layer were the key factor in mechanical strength formation of the basal internode and lodging resistance.",

          "text": "The remarkable increase in the yield of modern maize cultivars has been attributed mainly to an increase in plant density, which enables plants to intercept and use solar radiation more efficiently. Our study showed that both PAR at the ear (H 3 ) and IPAR in the H 3 -H 2 layer were significantly positively correlated with the structural carbohydrate content and RPS of the third internode, and significantly negatively correlated with lodging rate. These indicated that excess LAI in the upper canopy increased PAR interception by the upper canopy before flowering, which in turn caused a decrease in PAR at the ear and IPAR of the H 3 -H 2 layer. So the mechanical strength of the basal internode decreased and the lodging rate increased. The distribution of PAR within the canopy was also affected by leaf posture (i.e., leaf angle and leaf orientation value). When LAI is constant, upright leaves allow more PAR transmission into the maize canopy, whereas flat leaves intercept more PAR (Maddonni and Otegui 1996;Stewart et al. 2003). If upper leaves are relatively upright in closely planted maize then more light is transmitted into the lower parts of the canopy (Xue et al. 2001). Moreover, Ma et al. (2014) reported that maize plants with a low center of gravity height had high lodging resistance. Our results showed that removing leaves above the ear decreased the center of gravity height. At the same time, removing leaves above the ear also reduced the wind resistance of the maize plants. These factors reduce lodging risk.",

More PAR in the maize canopy and more IPAR below the ear could increase dry matter accumulation and promote the synthesis of structural carbohydrates.
