          "text": "Sweet maize is an annual plant that is extremely useful and economical for planting and harvesting. However, maize stands are damaged quickly in the case of nutrient and water deficiency. This research was carried out under dripping irrigation conditions and control plots without irrigation, involving seven different maize hybrids. The obtained results showed no existing variation in the dry matter content of cob (DMC) between the irrigated and non-irrigated treatments. Correlation analysis showed that increasing DMC causes decreasing moisture content of cob (MC) of sweet maize with irrigated and non-irrigated treatments. DMC and MC are important factors in the yield index on irrigation treatments. Biplots showed that the Dessert R72 (10.82) hybrid had maximum yield and effect on Brix/Abbe and Brix/Atago Pal-1, while the Messenger hybrids (42.96) had maximum effect on MC. It was also shown that DMC and MC are important factors in the yield index on irrigation treatments on hybrids. The Noa (37.97) and Honey hybrids (27.88) had minimum effect and performance on non-irrigation and irrigation treatments. The Messenger (11.25) and SF1379 hybrids (10.5) had a maximum performance on Brix Abbe and Brix Pal in the irrigation treatment and Dessert R78 (13.5), the Messenger hybrid (11.8) had a maximum performance on Brix/Abbe and Brix/Atago Pal-1 in non-irrigation treatment. The Dessert R78 (13.5) is the best-performing hybrid in terms of the yield of Brix/Abbe and Brix/Atago Pal-1 in the performed irrigation treatments.",

Considering the possibility of using fertilisers and toxic materials along with irrigation water and reducing their consumption, experts have mentioned the reduction of groundwater pollution as one of the advantages of reducing the consumption of fertilisers and toxic materials. Improving the efficiency of modern irrigation, optimising water consumption, creating fundamental changes in the irrigation method and developing irrigation under pressure at the level of gardens and farms to increase the productivity of production resources are considered among the best and most advanced methods . Precision agriculture plays a significant role in cost-and energy-efficient methods, with the aim of facilitating farmers' decision-making in cultivation technology. Dripping precision irrigation system can provide reliable irrigation to the entire land, such as corners and irregular shaped plots, which is not practical in other irrigation systems. Accurate water delivery through dripping precision irrigation systems has allowed researchers to improve the selection and identification of drought-resistant plant species. It is possible to precisely control the volume and time of nitrogen delivered to maize to improve the nitrogen efficiency used in precision irrigation systems . In addition, the use of precision irrigation plays an important role in achieving higher yields . Unpredictable precipitation distribution also has a significant impact on the cultivation of sweet maize. Sweet maize production without irrigation is inconceivable. The crop's greatest water demand is present from tasselling to grain-filling . Weather conditions can also significantly affect yield, grain weight, and the length of the growing season .",

Ertek and Kara , examining different irrigation levels on sweet maize yield, stated that the highest yield in the optimal irrigation treatment and the lowest yield in the treatment of 60% of plant water requirement was 14.8 and 11.5 tons per hectare, respectively. Results showed that increasing dry matter causes decreasing moisture. Akhavan et al.  reported that the highest grain yield had 125% of the plant water requirement of about 8.23 tons per hectare, and the lowest grain yield had only 50% of the water requirement of about 5.02 tons per hectare in sweet maize. Tagheian Aghdam et al. , by reporting the effect of different irrigation levels on the quantitative and qualitative yield of sweet maize, concluded that the different levels of irrigation had a significant effect on yield components. Siadat et al.  reported the production of sweet maize under low irrigation stress that drought stress reduced ear weight and grain yield compared to the control plots. Correlation analysis showed that increasing DMC causes decreasing moisture content on sweet maize with irrigated and non-irrigated treatments. In drought stress, reducing the transfer of nutrients affects the development of stem and leaf cells, and as a result, leads to a decrease in plant height, leaf area and grain protein content, and finally, a decrease in DMC accumulation in the seeds . The ear length, number of seeds per ear, and grain yield showed maximum correlation in sweet maize . Simple and multiple regression analysis methods, variance correlation, principal components analysis are used for yield components on crop production . Biplots showed that the Dessert R72 hybrid had maximum yield and effect on Brix/Abbe and Brix/Atago Pal-1 and GSS5649, and the Messenger hybrid had maximum effect on moisture content. It was also shown that DMC and moisture are important factors, as well as yield index on irrigation treatments in the case of the examined hybrids. The Noa and Honey hybrids had minimum effect and performance on non-irrigated and irrigated treatments. The Messenger and SF1379 hybrids had a maximum performance on Brix/Abbe and Brix/Atago Pal-1 with irrigation treatment and Dessert R78, Messenger hybrids had a maximum performance on Brix/Abbe and Brix/Atago Pal-1 in the non-irrigated treatment. The Dessert R78 is the best hybrid concerning yield on Brix/Abbe and Brix/Atago Pal-1 in irrigation treatments. Some researchers reported that water stress was effective in the grain filling stage in maize, i.e., this period was 13-3 days long, in the case of different hybrids, respectively . One of the most important factors affecting crop grain yield is hybrids, which effectively influences hybrids in different climates, temperatures and radiation . Ghazian Tafrishi et al.  reported decreasing number of seeds per cob in the yield of different sweet maize under water stress conditions. The reproductive growth stage in sweet maize has been introduced as one of the sensitive stages to water stress; As the stress of dehydration before silking leads to a sharp decline in grain yield through a negative impact on growth and reproductive development, including the embryonic sac and organ development . Also, there is a variation on yield indices parameters on hybrids and irrigation and hybrid in irrigation interaction. Nemeskéri et al.  reported a decrease in yield due to water stress at this stage, resulting in a 22.1 to 15.1 percent loss compared to normal conditions. Many researchers consider the leaf surface development stage (vegetative growth stage) to be one of the most sensitive stages of sweet maize growth to water scarcity stress (hence the importance of providing adequate moisture . Dessert R78 and Dessert R72 hybrids had stability on non-irrigation; these hybrids had good performance on non-irrigation condition. The SF1379 and Honey hybrid had suitable performance in precision irrigation. DMC and MC had maximum effect on hybrids in precision irrigation. Weight of cob had more effect on hybrids in non-irrigation. This study showed that weight of cob is important plant part in non-irrigation condition. The weight of cob can help to increase the performance of maize in non-irrigation conditions. In general, irrigation water treatments significantly affected maize performance and its quantitative characteristics, including ear length, net ear length, ear weight, number of the kernel, Brix/Atago Pal-1, and Brix/Abbe. The result based on the hybrids in irrigation showed that the response of the hybrids had variation based on the irrigation and non-irrigation because of different root systems. In addition, the examined hybrids reacted and responded differently based on irrigation to change to non-irrigation. Adequate moisture supply from the granulation stage is very important. If the plant has no water stress in any form (under-irrigation or cessation of irrigation) before the flowering stage, it will be able largely to have the best performance. If there is stress in the granulation stage, severe performance decline can be prevented. Also, according to the available reports, the greatest effect of moisture stress in the grain filling stage is on the grain yield and the stresses that occur after silking lead to smaller grain size .",
