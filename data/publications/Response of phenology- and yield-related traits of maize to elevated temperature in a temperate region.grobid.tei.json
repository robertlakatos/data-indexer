          "text": "Extreme high temperatures detrimental to maize production are projected to occur more frequently with future climate change. Phenology and yield-related traits were investigated under several levels of elevated temperature in two early-maturing hybrid cultivars: Junda 6 (grown in northeastern China) and Chalok 1 (grown in South Korea). They were cultivated in plastic houses in Suwon, Korea (37.27°N, 126.99°E) held at target temperatures of ambient (AT), AT + 1.5 °C, AT + 3 °C, and AT + 5 °C at one sowing date in 2013 and three different sowing dates in 2014. Vegetative and reproductive growth durations showed variation depending on sowing date, experimental year, and cultivar. Growth duration tended to decrease, but not necessarily, with temperature elevation, but somewhat increased again above a certain temperature. High temperature-dependent variation was greater during grain filling than in the vegetative period before anthesis. Elevated temperature showed no significant effects on duration or peak dates of silking and anthesis, and thus on anthesissilking interval. Grain yield tended to decrease with temperature elevation above ambient, showing a sharper linear decrease with mean growing season temperature increase in Junda 6 than in Chalok 1. The decrease in kernel number accounted for a much greater contribution to the yield reductions due to temperature elevation than did the decrease in individual kernel weight in both cultivars. Individual harvestable kernel weight was not significantly affected by temperature elevation treatments. Kernel number showed a linear decrease with mean growth temperature from early ear formation to early grain-filling stage, with Junda 6 showing a much severer decrease than Chalok 1. Kernel number reduction due to temperature elevation was attributable more to the decrease in differentiated ovule number than to the decrease in kernel set in Chalok 1, but largely to the decrease of kernel set in Junda 6.",

However, global warming has already exerted substantial negative impacts on maize yield in many regions , lowering global maize yield by 4% over the 29-year period from 1980 to 2008 . Although historical warming has led to large annual increases in maize yield in some regions , even more-dramatic impacts on maize yield and food security are expected under future climate regimes: in the tropics and subtropics by the end of this century the growing season temperatures will exceed the most extreme temperatures recorded in the past century and in temperate regions the hottest seasons on record will represent the future norm in many regions . Higher growing-season temperatures will reduce maize yield in diverse regions of the world and exacerbate food insecurity . Chen et al.  reported that daily minimum temperature was the dominant factor in maize production. Maize yield was significantly correlated with daily minimum temperature in May and September.",

          "text": "Maize yield is determined by the combination of two yield components: kernel number and individual kernel weight , which are highly influenced by environmental conditions during the flowering stage  and grain-filling period , respectively. Reproductive organs have a considerably lower temperature threshold for damage by heat stress than other organs . Yield reduction due to high temperature during reproductive phase is associated with a decrease in kernel number and weight. High temperature reduces the number of kernels per ear by reducing the number of ovules that differentiate, are fertilized, and develop into kernels  and by increasing kernel abortion during kernel development . High temperature-induced failure of fertilization of ovule is attributed primarily to the abnormal development of male reproductive tissues, which are more sensitive to heat stress than female reproductive tissues . Pollen viability and in vitro germination are reduced under high temperature . Asynchronous timing of anthesis and silking is also an important factor leading to decrease of fertilized ovules  and is known to be highly influenced by drought stress  and heat stress . Heat stress during the early stage of kernel development disrupts endosperm development and leads to abortion or premature cessation of growth . The latter authors reported that long-term heat stress, applied at 35 °C for 8 days beginning three days after pollination, resulted in abortion of 97% of kernels, whereas short-term heat stress at 35 °C for 4 days resulted in less abortion, of 23%, owing to a recovery of kernel growth and water content following heat stress. Kernel weight is determined by biomass accumulation within kernels during the grain-filling period that is dependent mainly on kernel growth rate and the duration of the effective filling period , both of which are affected by temperature and assimilate availability . High temperature stress during this period reduces the duration of grain filling , potential kernel size by inhibiting endosperm cell division and amyloplast biogenesis , and assimilate availability , leading to reduced final kernel weight . Heat stress effects on final kernel weight were larger when the stress occurred during the first half of effective grain filling than when it occurred around flowering, and larger for temperate than for tropical hybrids .",

In this study, high-temperature effects on phenological development, flowering characteristics, yield-related traits, and grain yield were investigated under several levels of temperature elevation above current ambient temperature in a temperate region. In general, temperature elevation above the current ambient temperature tended to reduce grain yield by exerting negative effects on almost all the yield-determining traits except harvestable kernel weight: vegetative and reproductive growth duration, kernel number, and its determining traits. Growth durations from emergence to anthesis and from anthesis to physiological maturity tended to decrease; however, above a certain level of temperature elevation, these growth durations somewhat lengthened again (Differences in days from emergence to anthesis (E to A), anthesis to physiological maturity (A to M), and emergence to physiological maturity (E to M) of two maize cultivars at different sowing dates under elevated temperature treatments in 2013 and in 2014).

Edeira et al. [25] also reported that heat stress immediately before silking (V 15 -V 17 ) reduced the number of differentiated florets only in temperate and temperate × tropical and not in tropical hybrids. Kernel set as affected by temperature elevation was predominantly determined by ovule nonfertilization in Junda 6, but determined by both ovule nonfertilization and kernel abortion with slightly greater importance of kernel abortion in Chalok 1 (Fig. 2). High temperature-induced ovule nonfertilization results mainly from the abnormal development of male reproductive tissue, as male reproductive tissue is more sensitive to heat stress than female [19]. Many studies have indicated that pollen produced under high temperatures above 35 °C had reduced viability and in vitro germination [16,17,19,20]. Although both cultivars represented similar ranges in mean maximum temperature during the six-day period after silking, Junda 6 showed much greater nonfertilization than Chalok 1 (Kernel number-related traits, kernel number, kernel weight, and grain yield of maize cultivars Junda 6 and Chalok 1 grown under temperature conditions elevated above ambient at different sowing dates in 2013 and 2014. a). Nonfertilization in Junda 6 tended to increase substantially with temperature increase, whereas in Chalok 1 it was much milder and showed no significant correlation with temperature during the silking period (Tables 2 and5).

Junda 6, in contrast, showed a significant decrease in percent aborted ovules with temperature elevation.
