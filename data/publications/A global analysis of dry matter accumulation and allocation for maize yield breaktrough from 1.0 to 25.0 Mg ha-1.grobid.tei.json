          "text": "Feeding a growing population requires improving crop yield without compromising the environment. Maize (Zea mays L.) is the largest food crop in the world. Identifying underlying drivers that increase maize yield is not only important for food security but also high resources use efficiency and environmental sustainability. Dry matter (DM) accumulation and its allocation to kernels are key factors that determine the final maize grain yield. To clarify the characteristics of DM accumulation, and allocation for maize yield breakthrough, data from previous publications from the 1970s to 2020s were collected and analyzed in combination with data from five years' field experiment conducted with six maize cultivars once yielding the highest in China and in all previous publications globally. As grain yield increased from 1.0 to 25.0 Mg ha -1 , a longer growth duration was essential, especially post-silking duration. A large but not excessive maximum leaf area index (LAI, 6.74) at silking was needed for crowded populations, and a relatively large LAI (3.35) at maturity was necessary. The pre-silking DM plateaued at 13.49 Mg ha -1 when grain yield exceeded 17.0 Mg ha -1 . The proportion of post-silking DM to total DM increased with yield and was about 70% when the yield level was 25.0 Mg ha -1 . By contrast, the DM transfer rate decreased with increasing yield. In addition, the harvest index (HI) could be further increased from a steady 0.52 to 0.55 when grain yield exceeded 10.1 Mg ha -1 . These innovative findings are of great significance for yield breakthrough and high resources use efficiency.",

The primary countries for maize production are the USA, China, Brazil, Argentina, etc., and the average yield is 5.8 Mg ha -1 in the global world (FAO, 2020). Maize production consumes great amounts of water and fertilizers, and produces massive straw, which is an important biofuel feedstock (Liu et al., 2022a). With the growth of the world economy and the increasing consumption of fossil fuels, the demand for biofuel will continue to increase (Mauser et al., 2015). The current increases in crop yields in the limited arable land are still not sufficient to satisfy the demands of the world's population by 2050 (Bailey-Serres et al., 2019). Therefore, increasing maize production per unit area is not only vital for future food security, but also for increasing resources use efficiency. It is also a critical approach to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) (FAO, 2015).",

A recent study stated that by increasing the plant density by 15,000 plants ha -1 without extra nitrogen input, the maize grain yield could increase by 2.7% -10.5% in China (Hou et al., 2020). This improvement of grain yield is mainly due to the fact that increasing plant density can improve light interception, photosynthesis, and light use efficiency and thus increase the aboveground dry matter (DM) accumulation and final grain yield (Maddonni et al., 2001;Li et al., 2011;Huang et al., 2017;Xu et al., 2017;Bernhard and Below, 2020).",

          "text": "The accumulated DM or photosynthate is the material base of yield formation. Increasing the total DM accumulation and the proportion of DM allocated to the kernels are the key factors for yield improvement (Rivera-Amado et al., 2019). A previous study with multisite experiments showed that the contribution of DM to grain yield was 73.7%, indicating it played an important role in varieties with a high yield level (Liu et al., 2020a). Many studies have pointed out that DM accumulation during post-sillking (from silking to maturity) is more important for modern maize cultivars (Yang et al., 2012;Zhou et al., 2016;Liu et al., 2017;Cao et al., 2021). The proportion of post-silking DM is more than 60% when the grain yield is > 18 Mg ha -1 , which is only 50% when the grain yield is < 9.0 Mg ha -1 (Meng et al., 2018). Therefore, higher DM accumulation or the proportion of post-silking DM is vital for achieving higher grain yields.",

          "text": "Previous studies showed that grain yield formation was mainly due to the transfer of DM from vegetative organs (Papakosta and Gagianas, 1991;Qi et al., 2020), and the total DM transfer rate could reach 46% (Huo et al., 2021). Other studies have found that the contribution of pre-silking DM is limited (Allison and Watson, 1966;Tollenaar, 1991), and there is little or no DM transfer under modern high-yield conditions (Srivastava et al., 2018;Zhang et al., 2020;Hu et al., 2021;Li et al., 2021). There exists a negative relationship between grain yield and rate of DM transfer from vegetative organs (Yi et al., 2006). More and more studies have shown that post-silking DM contributes much more to final grain yield under high-yield levels (Huang et al., 2007;Meng et al., 2016;Zhou et al., 2016;Liu et al., 2019). For high-yield maize grown under dense planting conditions, higher post-silking DM accumulation reduces DM transfer from vegetative organs, especially the stem, and thus reduces the risk of lodging (Xue et al., 2017). Therefore, for modern high-yield maize cultivation, a high DM transfer rate from vegetative organs may not be essential for yield formation because there is a large amount of DM accumulation during the grain filling stage.",

A previous study found that the HI did not change in the U.S. Corn Belt from the 1930s to 1970s while maize grain yield greatly increased (Meghji et al., 1984), as well as the found in Canada (Tollenaar, 1989). However, the HI of maize hybrids released from 1965 to 1993 increased from 0.41 to 0.52 in Argentina (Echarte and Andrade, 2003). In addition, there was also an increase of HI from 0.37 to 0.51 in China (Hou et al., 2012), and an analysis of data from previous studies showed that the HI did not increase when grain yield exceeded 15 Mg ha -1 (Liu et al., 2020a). In our previous study, we showed that an average HI of 0.54 could be achieved for a modern maize hybrid with yield potential of 22.5 Mg ha -1 by using precise field regulation strategies (Liu et al., 2017). Therefore, there is still potential to further improve the HI.",

          "text": "The increase in DM and final grain yield are related to the increase in leaf area (LA) and increased duration of the LA and growth period (Long et al., 2006;Ciampitti et al., 2013;Tian et al., 2020), and there is a significant relationship between grain yield and the duration of grain filling (Daynard et al., 1971;Poneleit and Egli, 1979;Liu et al., 2021a;Rizzo et al., 2022). Because of breeding for increased tolerance to density, the optimal plant density has increased greatly, and cultivars thus have a higher leaf area index (LAI) and increased light interception and use efficiency (Liu et al., 2022b). However, previous studies have shown that a LAI exceeding 5.0 is not necessary for obtaining high grain yield (Stewart et al., 2003;Liu et al., 2015;Liu et al., 2017), and that a LAI of about 5.0-6.0 might be optimal for maize (Li, 2000;Kiniry et al., 2004;Wang et al., 2004;Liu et al., 2020b). A recent meta-analysis showed that the highest maize grain yield was reached when the maximum LAI (MaxLAI) was 6.4 at density of 11.0 plants m -2 and that further increasing MaxLAI would decrease the photosynthetic rate (Hou et al., 2021b). In addition, early leaf senescence adversely affects crop yield during the grain filling stage (Gregersen et al., 2013), and the LAI for high-yield maize should be about 4.0 at maturity (Li, 2000;Liu et al., 2017). Therefore, a reasonable LAI is vital for high yield.",

So far, it is not clear in how to achieve yield potential of 25.0 Mg ha -1 .

A prolonged growth duration is related to higher DM accumulation and grain yield (Tian et al., 2020). By reviewing data from previous studies combined with data from five consecutive years' field experiments, we found that the pre-silking, post-silking, and whole growth durations significantly increased as grain yield increased from 1.0 to 25.0 Mg ha -1 (Fig. 2). A recent study found that a shorter vegetative phase and a longer grain filling phase were beneficial to the improvement of grain yield (Olmedo Pico and Vyn, 2021;Rizzo et al., 2022), which was not all consistent with our results. However other studies reported that high grain yield was related to a longer growth duration (Milander et al., 2017;Mason et al., 2018), which supported our findings. In this study, we found a relatively long vegetative phase but the proportion of vegetative phase (pre-silking) duration significantly decreased while the proportion of reproductive phase (post-silking) duration significantly increased (Fig. 2D). In addition, we obtained much higher yield level (average 19.6 Mg ha -1 , range 13.5-24.6 Mg ha -1 ) than that (15.3-16.3 Mg ha -1 ) reported by Rizzo et al. (2022). Therefore, a long, but not too long pre-silking stage and a relatively long post-silking stage are essential for improving grain yield.",

However, the maize canopy may suffer from shading because of excessive LAI (Hayashi et al., 2015;Xu et al., 2017;Liu et al., 2020b). In this study, we found that a MaxLAI of 6.7 at silking was enough when the grain yield exceeded 20 Mg ha -1 (Fig. 3). Previous studies also reported that a higher LAI was not necessary for obtaining high grain yield (Liu et al., 2017;Liu et al., 2020b;Liu et al., 2022c), which supported our result. A recent meta-analysis also showed an optimal LAI of 6.4 for higher grain yield (Hou et al., 2021b), which was similar with our finding. Moreover, early leaf senescence during the grain filling stage was reported to not be beneficial to grain yield improvement (Gregersen et al., 2013;Liu et al., 2022c), and that the LAI at maturity should be maintained at about 3.5-4.0 to prolong the photosynthetic capacity during the grain filling stage (Li, 2000;Liu et al., 2017;Liu et al., 2022c), which also supported our finding. Therefore, optimal LAI is vital for high grain yield under dense planting, not redundant.",

Our synthesis analysis showed that both the DM during post-silking and at maturity significantly increased with increasing grain yield (Fig. 4), which were attributed to the prolongation of growth duration (Fig. 2) and leaf greenness (Fig. 3). Previous studies also showed that post-silking DM was important for modern high-yielding maize hybrids (Yang et al., 2012;Zhou et al., 2016;Liu et al., 2017;Cao et al., 2021), and its proportion could increase to 70% for yield levels exceeding 18.0 Mg ha -1 (Meng et al., 2018), which was consistent with our finding at yield level of 25 Mg ha -1 . In addition, a previous study found a DM contribution of 74% to final grain yield (Liu et al., 2020a) and supported our result. However, the pre-silking DM did not significantly increase when grain yield exceeded 17.0 Mg ha -1 in this study. This result indicates that higher but not too much pre-silking DM is necessary (Fig. 8), which is consistent with our finding of not too long pre-silking duration (Fig. 2) and the result of Tollenaar (1991).",

On the contrary, other studies reported that post-silking DM was more important (Zhou et al., 2016;Liu et al., 2017;Cao et al., 2021), and that there was little or no DM transfer from vegetative organs (Srivastava et al., 2018;Zhang et al., 2020;Hu et al., 2021;Li et al., 2021), which was consistent with our results at higher yield levels.",

The increase of plant density increased the MaxLAI (Liu et al., 2022b), and the prolongation of leaf greenness could significantly reduce the DM transfer rate. Moreover, the use of density-tolerant cultivars and precise field regulation strategies delayed the leaf senescence and leaded to increased accumulation of photosynthates and reduction of DM transfer (Fig. 8), which was supported by a previous study (Liu et al., 2022c). Our result also showed that a severe reduction in LAI (leaf senescence) caused dramatic DM transfer. Excellent leaf greenness during grain filling promoted post-silking DM accumulation, and a relatively high pre-silking DM accumulation provided a strong base for post-silking growth, which contributed to lower DM transfer and high grain yield, and was consistent with the negative relationship between DM transfer rate and grain yield reported by Yi et al. (2006). Therefore, although density-tolerant hybrids are important for high-yield cultivation, precise field regulation strategies are essential for ensuring that plants maintain a well state under dense planting, as demonstrated by recent studies under favorable environments (Liu et al., 2021c;Rizzo et al., 2022).",
