          "text": "The fallow land represented a new growing area for the species. Today, maize is produced in very high quantities, i.e. at values of US$ 25 billion (thousand million), which means 40% of the world's production, and 25 maize plants are needed daily to maintain the American style of life for each American citizen. During recent years, China has been the country with the most dynamic development of maize cultivation. In 2003, 114 million tons of maize were produced, the second highest quantity in the world after the USA. Brazil and Mexico are the next most important maize producers, although even the USA increased its production by more than 100 million tons during the last 30 years. Today, an annual 236 million ton production by the USA is the most significant component of the world's supply. The expansion of maize cultivation has not stopped; there are new acquisitions continuously each year. Yields as well as total volumes have recently increased significantly.",

          "text": "At the same time, the growing area increased at a much lower rate (9.9%) and the increment was balanced across the continents. In the future it is expected that the main cause of increasing yields will be due to the intensification of growing technologies rather than to the increasing area. The five \"Great Powers\" of maize production are the USA (40%), China (19%), Brazil (5%), Mexico and Argentina (3% each), whereas France and Italy produce 2% each of the world's total (Figure 1.2). Within Europe, France occupies the leading position (1.7-1.8 million ha, with yields of 10 t/ha) followed by Italy (1.1 million ha, with yields of 11 t/ha). In both countries, irrigation is an essential component of high yields. Mean yields of maize increased by 32% during the period between 1991 and 2005, but the differences are large according to the growing sites. Hungary occupies 13 th position amongst maize growing countries with respect to mean yields and 8 th position as to the increment of yields. Among the countries growing more than 1 million ha maize, the mean yields of Hungary are in 3 rd or 4 th position after USA, France (and perhaps Italy).",

The leading countries will keep their position, but further exporting countries will appear (e.g. South Africa, Romania and Ukraine).
