          "text": "As long as economic progress continues in the most populated parts of the world -China, India, and North Africa -and their buying power increases, demands for agricultural products will boom significantly. New markets will open and the surplus offered by the North American growers will find plenty of selling opportunities in far away markets; the pressure of inner and outer offers will diminish on the European market (Udovecz 2003). With the rising prices and the accession of Hungary to the EU, it is expected that the relative importance of maize within the agricultural world will increase (Figure 2.1). As a consequence of its monopolistic position in production and exportation, the USA dictates the price of maize on the international market, and the price quotations of the Chicago Exchange are decisive.    forecast and the stock will attain about 6.5 Mt, of which 5 Mt will be offered for intervention.",

Climatic and soil conditions are favourable, and professional expertise and experiences strengthen Hungary's position in the European and the world market (Csíbor 2004). According to a bilateral agreement with the EU, Hungary was authorised to export 450 thousand tons of maize free of custom duties to the common market after August 2002. Cereal producers of the EU are protected by subsidised prices and import duties, which complement the favourable ecological conditions in stimulating maize production.",

The controversy of Agenda 2000 is that the reforms of the EU improved the position of subventions just of cereal production, which is in oversupply and should be restrained whereas it impaired that of other crops -e.g. oilseed and protein crops -which now must be imported.",

From the Hungarian point of view, we should emphasise that after the millennium maize production of the EU surpassed its domestic demand. The forecasts indicate that in the cereals market, the surplus of maize will be of most concern after wheat. This will have a significant impact on Hungary because being a full member, and the third maize producer of, the EU its auspicious chances on the cereal market would suffer.",
