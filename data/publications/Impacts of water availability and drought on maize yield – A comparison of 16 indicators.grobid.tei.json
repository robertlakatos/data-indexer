          "text": "Agricultural drought causes serious yield losses for rainfed crops (including C 4 crops) and is a cause of higher costs incurred by irrigation use. Drought episodes have been more frequent in Central Europe in recent years and have caused problems in terms of crop and livestock production due to a lack of available feed. The main aim of this study is to examine 16 water availability indicators (suitable for the evaluation of agricultural drought) to help explain maize silage yields. A parallel aim is to determine the period during which current maize hybrids for silage are the most vulnerable to water availability shortages. These aims reflect a current need for accurate drought impact assessment methods that can be applied as an early warning system or as part of a decision making protocol. For the purposes of this study, data from rainfed silage maize field experiments conducted between 2011 and 2015 in 4 locations (throughout the Czech Republic) were used. Relatively high correlations were found using precipitation totals for July alone, as this simple indicator explained 64% of the observed variability in the average silage yields of maize. Overall, the highest R 2 (coefficient of determination) of 0.77 was obtained when the sum of actual evapotranspiration (ETa) for May to August was applied as an independent variable. This indicator also gave the most consistent response for all of the individually assessed months. The lowest ETa totals from May to August occurred during an extremely dry year (2015). The significance of this drought episode was exacerbated by its spatial extent and severe impacts on regional maize silage yields throughout the entire Czech Republic. The selection of hybrids according to FAO numbers has not been proven (based on included data) to serve as an adequate adaptation measure for severe episodes of drought, although higher FAO values should provide slightly higher yields in such cases. The recommendation for farmers is not to rely on one hybrid alone, but instead use hybrids with different FAO values for a given year.",

          "text": "Water availability and drought episodes have become one of the main factors affecting field crop yields and variability in the Central European region, including in the Czech Republic (Hlavinka et al., 2009;Kolář et al., 2014;Brázdil et al., 2015;Potopová et al., 2015). This situation has been caused by climatic trends leading to drier conditions (e.g., Brázdil et al., 2008;Trnka et al., 2014aTrnka et al., , 2015a) ) and is due to the changed relationship between drought occurrence and its impacts on field crop yields (Trnka et al., 2012). Mentioned study on these trends reveals the potential impacts of ongoing climate change, and according to predictions for Central Europe, it will change agricultural conditions (Zalud et al., 2009) and will spur more frequent, severe, and likely prolonged episodes of drought (Trnka et al., 2013(Trnka et al., , 2015b)). This trend is problematic not only for C 3 plants but also for C 4 plants as shown by, e.g., Hlavinka et al. (2009) and Potopová et al. (2015). Drought conditions are expected to worsen, and even according to optimistic climate change scenarios (Trnka et al., 2014b). Maize production is threatened by this phenomenon, and this will come with serious repercussions for Central Europe and globally, as maize is one of the most important cereal crops grown worldwide. Maize is widely grown throughout the world in tropical, subtropical, and temperate climatic zones, is an important staple crop in many countries, and is used in animal feed and for many industrial applications (as a raw material; as a source of starch; as a sweetener; in oil, drinks, glues, alcohol, and fuel and as a source of biogas). Consequently, it is important to determine constraints on maize production, including the sensitivity of current hybrids to water availability and drought occurrence. This need is highlighted by the fact that almost all maize production in the Czech Republic is rainfed (without irrigation). The impacts of an extreme summer drought episode occurring in 2015 when maize yields were significantly reduced throughout the Czech Republic forced the government and EU to approve of compensation payments to afflicted farmers. Maize was cultivated on approximately 325 thousand hectares, of which 80 thousand hectares of maize was grown for grain while the remainder was grown for silage and green materials in the Czech Republic in 2015. The historical development of total maize acreage correlates with the number of cattle, which has declined significantly. Currently, due to new biogas station operations, this situation has partly stabilized. Compared to yields for 2014, maize grain yields were approximately 34% lower in 2015 with an average yield of 5.54 t/ha (Czech Statistical Office). Furthermore, the harvested maize silage yield was approximately 30.0% lower relative to the previous year, was the lowest since 2003 and was related to lower levels of nutrient quality (based on the total starch content). This drop in 2015 partly occurred due to the occurrence of an extreme summer agricultural drought in the Czech Republic when a severe dry episode occurred in the beginning of July and ended throughout much of the area on August 18th, 2015 due to the emergence of a cold front. The drought episode negatively affected biomass accumulation within the reproductive phenological stages. This period is particularly sensitive to stress due to the occurrence of intensive growth (e.g., Sirisampan and Zoebisch, 2005;Tolk et al., 2016). A second important feature of this episode involved a high number of very warm days. Additionally, another important feature pertained to the episode's spatial dimension, as the drought affected the entire Czech Republic territory (with the exception of mountainous regions).",

          "text": "The link between drought and maize growth and development can be investigated in terms of water use efficiency levels, e.g., by using lysimeters (e.g., Tolk et al., 2016), in terms of transpiration (Messina et al., 2015), or with a focus on radiation use efficiency (Earl and Davis, 2003). The sensitivities of selected hybrids have been investigated by, e.g., Kamara et al. (2003) and Spitko et al. (2014), and agronomic measures have been investigated by Sirisampan and Zoebisch (2005). Most results in this area have been obtained through field observations (e.g., Lobell et al., 2014), but crop growth models are often used as a research tool (e.g., Wu et al., 2015) and for extreme weather (heat waves and droughts) impact assessments of recent and future climatic conditions (e.g., Chung et al., 2014). This approach is limited in its high input data requirements for analyses, heavy requirements in terms of modeler skills (growth models are sophisticated tools), remaining uncertainties due to calibrations, and degrees of complexity or simplification in selected algorithms. These factors are certainly limit spatially universal, non-problematic and efficient (e.g., for the purposes of early warning systems) crop growth models for larger regions or states. On the other hand, the availability of simple, robust, and descriptive indicators for the evaluation of drought impacts is desirable.",

The locations of the stations, which are situated in nearly a straight line from west to east, are shown in Fig. 1. Altitudes and average annual temperature and precipitation levels for 2011-2015 and records for May to August of 1981-2010 (which are crucial for maize production) are listed in Overview of total average yearly air temperature and precipitation values and for May to August of 1981-2010 and of 2011-2015. The data are based on interpolated values drawn from the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute network of stations. The altitudes of Krásná Hora, Lípa and Dolní Heřmanice are almost identical (from 458 to 481 m a.s.l.) while the Švábenice station is situated at a lower altitude (288 m a.s.l.). Soil water holding capacity levels are similar among the first three stations (i.e., 142 mm of the soil water holding capacity) and are higher for Švábenice (i.e., 152 mm of the soil water holding capacity). Altitudes are reflected by average air temperatures (7.9-8.3 • C) for the first three stations as well as for Švábenice (9.1 • C) for 1981-2010. Precipitation totals vary from 568.2 mm (for Švábenice) to 680.9 mm (for Lípa) based on 1981-2010 values. Consequently, substantial differences can be observed in different years, and the driest year for the May to August period (for precipitation totals) was observed in 2015 for all of the studied stations. A comparison of drought episodes occurring throughout the Czech Republic from 2011 to 2015 based on periods in which relative soil saturation levels (based on soil water capacities of 0% at the wilting point to 100% at field capacity) remained under 50% from May to August of each year is shown in Fig. 2.

For the interpolation, the same methodology used by the Integrated Drought Monitoring System (www.intersucho.cz) and in studies conducted by Trnka et al. (2014aTrnka et al. ( , 2015a) ) was applied. To assess the spatial consistency of inputs (interpolated weather data and soil water holding capacity information) and drought occurrence, indicators were also derived for 5 × 5 km grids.

This means that consequently several regressions (second order polynomial functions) were thus calibrated using all of the years, but data on one year was left out. The developed model (using one regression function) with one year removed were then used to forecast crop yields for the missing year.

The correlation in this case is robust (without significant outliers), and the relatively steep slope, which can be expressed as a change in yields, shows an increase of approximately 2.2 t/ha for every 10 mm of ETa for these months. This result represents the crop water production function (CWPF), which is useful for any given regional condition (e.g., Saseendran et al., 2015). Moreover, the shape of the function is almost linear. This result agrees well with a known phenomenon that occurs when other factors are not extremely limiting, i.e., biomass produced and water consumed by a given plant species are linearly related to a certain threshold, at which point the slope is reduced due to a higher amount of water present. This relationship often holds for grain yields as well. In addition, Cakir (2004) revealed a close linear relationship between seasonal evapotranspiration rates and grain yields during dry periods, rainy periods, and years of normal precipitation levels and distributions. Their results were based on a three-year experiment on 16 variations of irrigation regimes (including rainfed) and for R 2 values varying from 0.74 to 0.88 (p < 0.01). On the other hand, the slope of this relationship was identified at a lower level (an order of magnitude), as grain yields were included (compared to above ground biomass levels considered in this study).

The relationship between May-to-August ETa values and observed yields was found to be quite stable at the separate stations though not in the case of Švábenice, for which the correlation was unable to completely explain the 2015 yield. This may be attributed to the presence of superior soil conditions (Phaeozems is found at the Švábenice location as soil with a higher water holding capacity) and hybrids with higher FAO values (see Fig. 3), as this station was the warmest. Alternatively, another factor not considered through the evaluated parameters (e.g., the presence of pests or diseases or the effectiveness of agronomical measures) may have had an effect.",

          "text": "Consequently, the UNISTAT software was used to test the predictive value (for separate hybrid yields) of combinations of assessed indicators and its second order (as independent variables) using a stepwise regression. The R 2 value for the calibration set of data (including odd data for the hybrids, years and stations) was found to be 0.85 while the MBE and RMSE were measured as -0.5 t/ha and 1.8 t/ha, respectively. Moreover, the R 2 value was equal to 0.80 while the MBE and RMSE were measured as -0.4 and 2.0 t/ha, respectively, for the validation component of the database (even values for 2011-2015 were included). For the 2015 dry year, it was possible to explain 77% and 64% of the observed yield variability (based on R 2 ) while MBEs were -0.1 t/ha and 0.1 t/ha and RMSEs were 1.8 t/ha and 2.3 t/ha across the individual hybrids and stations for calibration and validation parts of the database, respectively. The stepwise regression analysis yielded a higher level of explained variability (compared to using a single parameter) but comparable MBE and RMSE results. For a complete description of the procedure, it is necessary to state that apart from the water availability indicators, FAO values of the included hybrids were used as independent variables in the stepwise regression analysis. The proposed set of UNISTAT indicators (including coefficients for the regression equation and a parameter of statistical significance) is presented in . The coefficient for the FAO value indicates that the reproduced yield difference between the included hybrid with lowest FAO (i.e., 170) and highest FAO values (i.e., 570) is 3.12 t/ha. On the other hand, the FAO value has the second lowest statistical significance (see ). This result agrees with the variable hybrid reactions (with various FAO numbers) measured at the analyzed stations and across the studied seasons (see Fig. 5). Using hybrids with certain FAO values has not been proven (based on all yield data considered in this study) to serve as an adequate adaptation measure for severe episodes of drought. According to conclusions made by Gheysari et al. (2009), increasing nitrogen application rates to compensate for reduced aboveground biomass yields under drought stress is not good strategy. The effects of nitrogen fertilizer are dependent on water availability levels in the soil, and the amount of nitrogen fertilizer applied should be decreased under conditions of drought stress. While residual winter and spring soil moisture could be more effectively used by sowing maize earlier, the magnitude of this shift is limited by minimum soil temperatures for germination of roughly 6 • C. For the period around year 2070 with an expected temperature increase of 2.6 • C (based on the IPCM4 Global Circulation Model in combination with representative concentration pathway 4.5), earlier maize sowing by 2 weeks on average could be seen in the Czech Republic. Higher levels of dry matter production (at 0.6 t/ha) can be predicted due to such a shift in the sowing date based on HERMES model results (Hlavinka et al., 2015). Moreover, tillage and mulching techniques used could have important effect on yields made under drought conditions through better water infiltration systems and conditions for roots penetration, lower evaporation and increased soil water content levels and improved water use efficiency levels (e.g., Tao et al., 2015). Adapting to warmer and drier conditions could also involve the use of hybrids based on various earliness factors. According to an analysis on northern Germany, late varieties may benefit from the abovementioned conditions, and the transitioning of local agricultural practices toward such conditions is conceivable within this century (in connection with expected changes in climatic conditions). Moderate varieties could be problematic in coming decades while early varieties should have no significantly negative or positive effects (Degener and Kappas, 2015).",

For Švábenice, the highest degree of variability in hybrid yields was observed in 2015; otherwise, no other signal was apparent. Based on different reactions observed in individual seasons, it is recommended for farmers to not rely solely on one hybrid but rather use hybrids with various FAO numbers in one season.",

This did not change even when values for the 5 km squares were counted as averages for arable land. This result confirms that the outputs of indicators in the tested areas exhibit relatively high levels of spatial consistency and that significant effects of the quantitation (uncertainty) of soil water holding capacities in the 500 m grids were not confirmed. While the selected indicators used in this study were based on a monthly time step, which could be considered a blunt instrument, generally positive results were achieved, e.g., in comparison to those of more complex crop growth model (process-oriented) simulations based on a daily time step and detailed input data. Saseendran et al. (2015) presented yield estimates obtained by fitting linear yields vs. ETas comparable to those of the processoriented agricultural system model. Žalud and Dubrovsky (2002) used the CERES-Maize model (version 3.0) for grain yield estimates based on data for the station representing the warmest and driest region in the Czech Republic and achieved an R 2 value of 0.83 from the validation process. In this case, the model overestimated the observed yields by an average of 12%, and the standard deviation of the ratio of model to observed yields was found to be 11%. Brisson et al. (2002) achieved an R 2 value of 0.77 for biomass predictions and an R 2 value of 0.58 for grain yields under many agronomic conditions using the STICS crop growth model. Bouazzama et al. (2013) found R 2 = 0.97 and R 2 = 0.98 for maize yields simulated through irrigation experiments conducted in Morocco using the CropSyst and PILOTE models, respectively. When the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) was correlated by Potopová et al. (2015) based on the regional yields of 11 crops in the Czech Republic (data were obtained for a period of 52 years running from 1961 to 2012), the greatest yield-drought correlations were found for cereal crops (r = 0.52-0.60). The years 1976The years , 2003The years , 1994The years , 2007The years , and 2000 present the highest grain yield losses for maize at the national and regional levels when considering the intensity of the standardized yield residual series (SYRS). Spearman's rho correlation coefficients (r) between the monthly SPEI de-trended series with 1-12 month lag periods (derived from 304 stations) and the SYRS confirm that the grain yield of maize is highly sensitive to drought during the silking period (July-August). The greatest correlations were recorded for the SPEI with 3-7 month lag periods in August (r = 0.50-0.60). This result complements the results of Soderlund et al. (2014), who concluded that for grain production water restriction has the greatest negative effects during or after silking by reducing the number of kernels and by limiting kernel filling. In regards to silage production, water restrictions applied during the vegetative growth stage negatively impact plant heights and biomass yields. According Potopová et al. (2015), short-term drought stress (quantified by SPEI) occurring during the intense leaf growth stage (June; r = 0.43) is the second most central cause of reduced maize grain yields.",

          "text": "It can be concluded that short term drought occurrence in rainfed agricultural systems can significantly reduce the biomass production of maize silage in the Czech Republic, which may represent conditions of several Central European regions. This study is novel in its comparison of 16 different indicators of water availability and drought and of their effects on maize silage yields. It was shown that even relatively simple approaches could explain high degrees of observed yield variability and could be used to distinguish problematic seasons. It was shown that precipitation totals explain 64% of the yield variability observed across all stations and years and that July is the most crucial month. This result can be considered very important, as precipitation totals are usually evaluated for each farm (at least at the daily time step level). Using more complex parameters only leads to a certain degree of improvement. Overall, the highest correlation (R 2 = 0.77; p < 0.001) was obtained when the sum of the ETa for May to August was applied. This indicator provided the most consistent response for all of the assessed months. The correlation in this case is robust (without significant outliers) and has a relatively steep (almost linear) slope. When a combination of indicators in the stepwise regression procedure was used, the specific R 2 values were equal to 0.85 and 0.80 for calibration and validation, respectively (p < 0.001 in both cases). These results confirm that despite the temperature demands of maize, the availability of soil water is a crucial parameter and drought can explain the high degree of observed yield variability found. This pattern was observed even for stations positioned at higher altitudes, which are located in more humid and cooler areas than, e.g., the central Bohemian or the southern Moravian lowlands. This is an alarming finding given expected drying conditions (or increasing year-to-year variability in water balance) in these regions according to climate change scenarios. A related problem concerns the fact that almost all silage maize in the Czech Republic is rainfed and that the future development of irrigation for this crop will be limited by a lack of available infrastructure, economic factors (price of water vs. price of products), and the probably of low water availability in dry seasons. On the other hand, secure feed for livestock has become a high priority, and irrigation (even at a higher cost) could play a role in stabilization efforts.",

This result supports the importance of a functioning early warning system operating in real time that could allow farmers and authorities to obtain relatively accurate and regionally specific information (approximately 2 months before harvesting) on problems that have occurred. From such activities, severe impacts could be curtailed by individual farmers (e.g., ensuring sufficient quantities of quality feed drawn from regions not presenting drought impacts) and by the entire sector (preparation and establishment of compensatory measures and payments to stabilize conditions in affected regions). Precise yield impact estimates are very valuable not only for farmers but also for other individuals interested in agriculture, including decision makers and executive staff. As one simple adaptation measure, farmers could use not only one hybrid (with the same FAO number) but instead a combination of different hybrids with various FAO numbers. Using hybrids with certain FAO numbers has not proven to serve as an adequate adaptation measure for severe episodes of drought (according to the data considered).",
