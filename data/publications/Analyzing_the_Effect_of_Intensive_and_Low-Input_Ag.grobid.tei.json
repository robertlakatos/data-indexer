Correlation and biplot analysis show that increases in the lipid peroxidation (LP) amount in the plant leaf stages cause a decrease in the oil content of the harvested yield. e activity of ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and LP at the six-leaf stage directly affects the protein content. e amount of APX at the silking stage has a direct and significant effect on starch content. is study showed that the activity of APX at the silking stage has the highest value in all examined hybrids. APX and LP can be controlled with nitrogen fertilization under various environmental circumstances.",

A substantial part of the applied fertilizers is nitrogen, which has a significant effect on the plant's physiological processes. Regarding the physiological responses of maize, the question arises as to how the antioxidant defense system reacts and what effect it has on lipid peroxidation.
