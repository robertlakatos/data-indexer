          "text": "Drought and heat are major environmental stresses that continually influence plant growth and development. Under field conditions, these stresses occur more frequently in combination than alone, which magnifies corresponding detrimental effects on the growth and productivity of agriculturally important crops. Plant responses to such abiotic stresses are quite complex and manifested in a range of developmental, molecular, and physiological modifications that lead either to stress sensitivity or tolerance/resistance. Maize (Zea mays L.) is known for its sensitivity to abiotic stresses, which often results in substantial loss in crop productivity. Bioaugmentation with plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) has the potential to mitigate the adverse effects of drought and heat stresses on plants. Hence, this is considered a promising and eco-friendly strategy to ensure sustainable and long-term maize production under adverse climatic conditions. These microorganisms possess various plant growth-promoting (PGP) characteristics that can induce drought and heat tolerance in maize plants by directly or indirectly influencing molecular, metabolic, and physiological stress responses of plants. This review aims to assess the current knowledge regarding the ability of PGPR to induce drought and heat stress tolerance in maize plants. Furthermore, the drought and heat stress-induced expression of drought and heat stress response genes for this crop is discussed with the mechanisms through which PGPR alter maize stress response gene expression.",

More than 73% of maize growing areas are situated in developing countries, where maize is a staple food crop for millions of people (Shiferaw et al., 2011;Tesfaye et al., 2018). As such, the demand for maize is expected to increase due to the escalations in both food consumption and feed requirements driven by population growth and economic development (Shiferaw et al., 2011). Furthermore, climate change threatens to worsen these existing challenges and further undermine the efforts made to reduce poverty and enhance food security within these regions (Tesfaye et al., 2017). Moreover, the temperatures over Africa are expected to rise even more rapidly, with increases estimated to exceed 2 • C by 2050 (Barros and Field, 2014;Tesfaye et al., 2018). Meanwhile, temperatures over large areas have already exceeded the threshold for maize growth (Cairns et al., 2013;Nelimor et al., 2019). Moreover, global rainfall under future climate change scenarios will either stop pre-season or occur later than usual; worldwide maize production is threatened (Lobell et al., 2011).",

These modifications can promote stress tolerance, resistance, or stress sensitivity (Harb et al., 2010). Detrimental effects on plants, such as disruptions in cellular homeostasis, hindrance in growth and development, reduced yield, and plant death, have been reported under heat and drought stresses (Barnabás et al., 2008;Tiwari and Yadav, 2019). To survive, plants must respond and adapt to such stresses. However, they are currently being challenged beyond their capacity to adapt (physically, biochemically, and molecularly) to current climate changeinduced variations in temperature and precipitation patterns (Hussain et al., 2019). This is largely due to the lack of energy and resources required by plants to adapt to such abiotic stress conditions; for example, limited energy for the production of stress response proteins such as late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins or heat shock proteins (HSPs) (Mittler, 2006).",

The co-occurrence of both high temperature and drought has been shown to considerably increase the negative effects on plants, such that the resulting consequences substantially surpass the straightforward additive impact of single stresses (Hussain et al., 2019). Simulation results suggest that climate change scenarios concerning the combination of reduced rainfall and increasing temperatures resulted in diminishing average maize yields by 21%, 33%, and 50%, under 1, 2, and 4 • C warming, respectively (Tesfaye et al., 2018). Lobell et al. (2011) demonstrated that an increase of 1 • C above 30 • C resulted in a 1% decrease in maize grain yield under optimal growing conditions, with a 1.7% reduction observed under drought stress. Alarmingly, reductions up to 40% or more were observed under the combination of drought and heat stresses. Similarly, Meseka et al. (2018) found that while drought stress reduced maize grain yield by up to 58%, the combination of drought and heat stresses reduced maize grain yield by 77%, highlighting the severity of the combined effects of these two stresses. According to Mittler (2006), plant metabolic and molecular responses to the combined effect of these stresses are unique and cannot be extrapolated from the responses induced by each of these stresses applied individually. This is a result of the close association between temperature and plant water status, thus making it impossible to distinguish whether stresses in the field are caused by heat or drought (Pandey et al., 2015;Shahsavandi et al., 2016).",

In some methods, beneficial plant-microbe interactions are exploited and these are considered promising areas for the focus of sustainable agricultural developments (Reddy et al., 2014). Beneficial soil microorganisms such as plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) and mycorrhizal fungi produce large quantities of plant growth-promoting substances (Camele et al., 2019). They are also capable of directly and indirectly influencing the growth and morphology of plants, thereby enhancing development and yield. Consequently, these substances have been successfully applied as biofertilizers or phytostimulants in agriculture (Bano et al., 2013). Another remarkable feature is their ability to support plants in stressed environments. They can protect plants against detrimental effects of various environmental stresses, such as drought and elevated temperatures, to which crop plants are intermittently exposed (Chukwuneme et al., 2020;Hassan et al., 2020;Pereira et al., 2020). The use of PGPR as biostimulants offers an eco-friendly, inexpensive, and ethically-unrestricted approach to solving the crises associated with drought and heat stresses. Therefore, we will provide an overview of the present knowledge about the mechanisms utilized by PGPR to induce tolerance in maize plants under drought and heat stresses, as well as their combined effects. We also highlight the drought and heat stress response genes affected by these abiotic stresses, and how PGPR alters the expression of such stress response genes.",

This group comprises different bacteria genera including Bacillus, Serratia, Azospirillum, Arthobacter, Enterobacter, Burkholderia, Alcaligenes, Azotobacter, Pseudomonas, and Klebsiella. The PGPR exert several positive effects on plants, ranging from direct mechanisms aimed at plant nutrition and plant growth regulation to indirect effects related to their biocontrol activity (Guerrieri et al., 2020). Another remarkable feature is their ability to induce plant tolerance to abiotic stresses (Danish et al., 2020a).

Furthermore, based on their interactions with the plant, PGPR can be separated into two categories, namely symbiotic and free-living (Singh, 2018). The former are known as intracellular PGPR (iPGPR) and inhabit root cells or intercellular spaces, while the latter are called extracellular PGPR (ePGPR) and exist outside the plant but within the rhizoplane or rhizosphere (Hayat et al., 2010;Singh, 2018).",

          "text": "The biological and physicochemical properties of the soil are heavily altered during drought and heat stresses, and as a result, the soil becomes unsuitable for microbial and crop growth (Meseka et al., 2018;Tesfaye et al., 2018). However, interactions that occur between PGPR and plants can alleviate such stresses. Several processes have been proposed to promote PGPR-induced heat and drought stress tolerance in plants (Fig. 1). These include modification in root morphology, phytohormonal levels, antioxidant defence, production of bacterial exopolysaccharides (EPS) and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic deaminase, and the accumulation of several compatible organic solutes, such as sugars, amino acids, and polyamines (Ali et al., 2011;García et al., 2017). The production of HSPs, dehydrins, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) also plays a significant role in the acquisition of drought and heat tolerance (Kaushal and Wani, 2016;Elshafie et al. 2017a, b). Furthermore, PGPR can initiate chemical and physical changes in maize plants, resulting in improved resilience to environmental stresses through induced systemic tolerance (Kannojia et al., 2019). These defence mechanisms can cause substantial alterations in the structural and functional characteristics of plants, leading to abiotic stress resistance (Misra et al., 2017;Sarkar et al., 2018). Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria can achieve this feat largely because they can respond to stress in similar ways to plants suffering hydric or heat stress when water availability is low or when temperatures are high. Microorganisms sense changes such as increased temperatures and salt concentrations in soil as osmotic variations and respond accordingly (García et al., 2017). Because of their ability to sense these changes in the soil, PGPR are quite specialized in their response to abiotic stresses, which influences how they induce plant growth. Therefore, they are ideal targets for use in improving overall maize productivity.",

Drought triggers multiple effects that manifest at both molecular and morphological levels, and these effects can be observed at all plant growth stages when water deficit is experienced. Drought stress weakens the metabolic activity of maize, decreases its biomass accumulation, and reduces its photosynthetic rate by decreasing chlorophyll content in leaves, which inevitably leads to a decrease in maize yield (Song et al., 2019). Moreover, drought-stressed plants show decreased cell turgor and water potential in the extracellular matrix and cytosol, resulting in reduced cell size, inhibited growth, and a failure to reproduce (Kapoor et al., 2020). Moreover, oxidative stress caused by the over-production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as a secondary stress causes wilting, further aggravating the adverse effects of drought stress (Anjum et al., 2017;Hussain et al., 2019) (Fig. 2).",

The application of synthetic and natural plant growth factors has been demonstrated to enhance plant growth under environmental stresses (Vurukonda et al., 2016;Ahmad et al., 2019;Tayyab et al., 2020). These plant growth factors include gibberellin, uniconazole, brassinolide, 1aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic, jasmonic acid, abscisic acid (ABA), indole acetic acid (IAA), salicylic acid (SA), and zeatin (Pavlović., 2018;Ullah et al., 2018). Ethylene and ABA are plant growth-suppressing hormones, whereas others such as auxins, SA, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC), gibberellin, and zeatin act as growth promoters; hence, their ratio dictates plant growth response, especially under stressed conditions (Weiss and Ori, 2007). As maize plants are intimately linked with PGPR that reside within plant tissues or the rhizosphere, microbial-derived phytohormones strongly influence plant physiological processes and metabolism under hostile environmental conditions. Indole acetic acid, a particularly well-studied phytohormone secreted by PGPR, has been shown to play numerous roles in growth and developmental events such as cell division, elongation, and differentiation (Asgher et al., 2015;Egamberdieva et al., 2017).",

Similarly, maize plants inoculated with Pseudomonas fluorescens strain 153 exhibited increased auxin, ABA, cytokinin, and gibberellin contents in the leaves, while alleviating the effects of water deficiency (Ansary et al., 2012). Similarly, an ABAproducing Azospirillum lipoferum increased the ABA content of maize subjected to drought stress and was treated with fluridone (ABA inhibitor) by 24% (Cohen et al., 2009). This translated to improved root and shoot dry biomass by approximately 100% and 60%, respectively. As this trend was also observed in well-watered inoculated plants, the results imply that Azospirillum was responsible for increased ABA. Abscisic acid is a stress-related hormone that regulates the water balance of plants and cellular dehydration tolerance through stomatal closure and the induction of genes that encode dehydration tolerance proteins (Fernando and Schroeder, 2016;Gowtham et al., 2021). In contrast, compared to maize control plants, those inoculated with Herbaspirillum seropedicae Z-152 (29.5% biomass increase) and Azospirillum brasilense SP-7 (26% biomass increase) exhibited greater resistance to the negative effects of drought stress, with lower levels of plant growth-suppressing hormones, such as ABA and ethylene (Curá et al., 2017). These studies indicate that inoculation with PGPR has the potential to induce tolerance to water deficit stress conditions in maize by regulating phytohormonal content.",

However, unlike the direct production of hormones by PGPR, ACC deaminase activity indirectly lowers the level of ethylene by breaking down ACC in plant tissues, thereby reducing the negative effects of ethylene (Gupta and Pandey, 2019). Ethylene is regulated by biological and environmental factors, and its biosynthetic pathways include the conversion of S-adenosylmethionine (S-AdoMet) to ACC (immediate precursor of ethylene) by the enzyme 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase (Hardoim et al., 2008). Plants subjected to stress conditions have reduced root and shoot growth due to ethylene, which endogenously regulates plant homoeostasis. Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria can sequester and degrade ACC to α-ketobutyrate and ammonia using ACC deaminase, thereby supplying plants with nitrogen and energy (Gupta and Pandey, 2019). This was observed with bioinoculations of maize plants with drought-tolerant and ACC deaminaseproducing Streptomyces pseudovenezuelae and Arthrobacter arilaitensis strains, which increased plant growth and reduced the undesirable effect of drought stress on maize plant (Chukwuneme et al., 2020). Co-inoculation significantly increased maize shoot weight by 81.9%, 44.9%, and 139.5% at field capacity, moderate waterapplication, and zero water application conditions, respectively, while lower shoot weights were observed in the uninoculated plants under the same water regimes. A combination of four P. fluorescens strains (P1, P3, P8, and P14) possessing ACC deaminase activity among other PGP traits significantly increased the ear (44%) and canned seed yield (27%) of sweet corn under limited irrigation compared with controls (Zarei et al., 2020). Similarly, a combination of ACC deaminase-containing PGPR (A. xylosoxidans) and biochar (0.75%) significantly enhanced maize growth and productivity under drought stress. Under severe drought stress, maize plants exhibited per plant increases of 200%, 213%, 113%, 152%, 148%, and 284% in yield, photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, chlorophyll a content, total chlorophyll content, and carotenoid content, respectively, compared with controls (Danish et al., 2020b).",

However, there is little information on how the volatile compounds produced by PGPR improve drought stress tolerance, specifically in maize plants. Nevertheless, Bacillus mojavensis, a close relative of B. subtilis, and an endophytic bacterium of maize has been shown to produce the VOCs acetoin and 2, 3-butanediol, which are linked to plant growth-promoting attributes (Bacon and Hinton, 2002;Rath et al., 2018). Another bacterium, Enterobacter aerogenes, has been found to produce 2, 3-butandiol, which renders maize plants more resistant to biotic stresses (D'alessandro et al., 2014). Similarly, VOCs produced by P. pseudoalcaligenes have been shown to promote plant growth and induce maize resistance to drought stress. Increased shoot (118.2%) and root (133.3%) lengths were observed in plants exposed to the VOCs from P. pseudoalcaligenes, compared to control plants under drought stress (Yasmin et al., 2020).

Under water deficit conditions, plants adjust their metabolic processes to accumulate compatible solutes such as polyamines, polyhydric alcohols, sugars, betaines, quaternary ammonium compounds, proline, and other amino acids (Ahemad and Kibret, 2014). Inoculation with PGPR has been shown to mitigate drought stress by modulating the production of these osmolytes in plants. For instance, Sandhya et al. (2010) reported increased relative water content, leaf water potential, and plant biomass due to the accumulation of soluble sugars, free amino acids, and proline in maize plants when they were primed with Pseudomonas putida GAP-P45. Moreover, PGPR-inoculated plants under drought stress conditions have increased concentrations of proline from the upregulation of proline biosynthesis pathways, thereby protecting proteins and membranes from stress by maintaining cell turgor and its associated osmoprotective properties (Sandhya et al., 2010). Inoculating plants with proline-producing PGPR supplements internal proline concentrations (Ansary et al., 2012). Gusain et al. (2015) concluded that the accumulation of proline in plants inoculated with PGPR indicates that plant become more tolerant to drought stress. Maize seedlings inoculated with Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes showed increased proline content, by 135% in roots and 102% in shoots, compared to control plants under drought stress. This led to increases in the dry weight of roots and shoots under drought stress by 84.2% and 140%, respectively, compared to controls (Yasmin et al., 2020). Azospirillum (Az19) can produce trehalose (4.4 µg mg -1 fresh weight), another osmoprotectant found in nature, which was 388% greater than that produced by the reference strain (García et al., 2017). Moreover, maize inoculation with Az19 improved plant response to stress, increasing the proline content of roots 11.6 times compared with uninoculated controls. This study demonstrated a positive association between osmotic stress tolerance and trehalose level. It is hypothesized that minute amounts of trehalose are transported to maize roots and stimulate plant stress-resistant pathways (Rodríguez-Salazar et al., 2009). Similarly, maize inoculation with Raoultella planticola YL2 substantially enhanced the accumulation of osmolytes such as choline and glycine betaine, which in turn improved leaf relative water content and dry weight under drought stress (Gou et al., 2015). These studies show that PGPR-produced osmolytes can not only directly affect cell turgor maintenance in maize plants under drought stress, but can also indirectly affect plant drought tolerance by acting as signalling molecules.",

Thus, the EPS production of Rhizobacteria is thought to participate in mitigating the effects of drought stress. Exopolysaccharides effectively improve the surface attachment of bacteria, biofilm formation, microbial aggregation, and plant-microbe interactions. Exopolysaccharides are released into the soil as slime and capsular materials, which are subsequently adsorbed by clay surfaces via mechanisms such as anion adsorption, cation bridges, Van der Waals forces, and hydrogen bonding (Sandhya et al., 2010). This leads to the formation of a defensive rhizosheath around soil aggregates that decreasing desiccation time and provides an environment capable of holding more water; thus, plant roots are protected from drying for longer periods (Khan and Bano, 2019).",

Reactive oxygen species are partially reduced or activated forms of atmospheric oxygen (O 2 ), which are by-products of aerobic metabolism due to the impairment of the electron transport system (Choudhury et al., 2017). Normally, ROS are controlled by a delicate balance between production and scavenging via a highly efficient scavenging mechanism (Hasanuzzaman et al., 2019;Tripathi et al., 2020). Examples of ROS include hydroxyl radicals (OH), superoxide anion radicals (O •- 2 ), hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ), and alkoxy radicals (RO) (Choudhury et al., 2017). Organelles that are primary targets for ROS production under drought conditions include mitochondria, chloroplasts, and peroxisomes (Vurukonda et al., 2016). Uncontrolled ROS accumulation can damage normal cell functions by causing oxidative damage, resulting in DNA nicking, impaired production of amino acids and photosynthetic pigments, and increased lipid peroxidation (Farooq et al., 2009;Raja et al., 2017). The oxidative degeneration of lipids leads to the accumulation of malondialdehyde (MDA), a product of free oxygen radicals (Kong et al., 2016;Morales and Munné-Bosch, 2019). Therefore, MDA is widely accepted as an indicator of oxidative damage through lipid peroxidation. To overcome these effects, plants possess an antioxidant defence system composed of both enzymatic and non-enzymatic components in plant cells (Das et al., 2016). Scavenging of ROS by both components of the antioxidant defence system alleviates oxidative damage in plant tissues. The non-enzymatic component includes α-tocopherol, reduced glutathione, β-carotene, and ascorbic acid, whereas the enzymatic component includes glutathione reductase, catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDHAR), guaiacol peroxidase (POX), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) (Şen, 2012;Hasanuzzaman et al., 2019).",

Similarly, Khan and Bano (2019) showed that the combined treatment of Planomicrobium chinense, Bacillus cereus, and SA significantly decreased the activities of antioxidant enzymes CAT, peroxidase, and APOX by 46%, 63%, and 38%, respectively, in a maize genotype sensitive to drought stress. This translated to increases up to 59% and 75% in the shoot and root dry weight of maize, respectively. In contrast, Pseudomonas inoculation on maize transplant plants under severe water stress increased CAT activity by 50% compared to well-watered plants, alleviating the adverse effects of water stress on the physiological characteristics of maize (relative water content increase by 8%) (Rezazadeh et al., 2019). Soaking of maize seeds in Bacillus megaterium HX-2 suspension increased SOD, peroxidase, and CAT activities under drought by 19.37%, 19.86%, and 10.96%, respectively, leading to a 42.38% reduction of MDA content (Li et al., 2019). The decreased MDA accumulation in PGPR-inoculated maize plants suggests reduced lipid peroxidation under drought stress. This highlights that plant drought tolerance induced by altering antioxidant enzymes can result either from the activation or suppression of antioxidant activity. These studies prove that the alteration of antioxidant activity in plants by PGPR can be beneficial for the enhancing drought tolerance, growth, and development of maize plants.",

Commonly, plants maintain high cell turgor by stabilizing water content in their tissues, even during sudden minor temperature fluctuations when not much moisture is available. However, continued increase in temperature proves fatal under water deficit conditions (Machado and Paulsen, 2001). Under field conditions worldwide, heat stress generally occurs in conjunction with water stress (Thayil et al., 2020). Generally, the loss of water under heat stress is greater during the day, primarily due to elevated transpiration rates, which ultimately impairs vital physiological activities in plants, and maize is no exception. Instant decreases in leaf tissue water content, altered root conductance, extensively enhanced respiration, and opening of stomata have been observed under heat stress (Fig. 3) (Kandel et al., 2018).",

However, the intensity and duration of stress can negatively influence the effects of ethylene (Savada et al., 2017). An initial minor peak in ethylene level initiates a protective response in the plant; however, after some time, a second larger peak reportedly induces abscission, chlorosis, and senescence, all of which are detrimental to plant survival (Glick, 2005;Cicchino et al., 2013).

One study has reported that most of the known ACC deaminaseproducing isolates that demonstrate tolerance to high temperature (45 • C) were Bacillus spp. (Misra et al., 2017). Mukhtar et al.

Moreover, the bacteria could survive temperatures up to 60 • C. The heat tolerance and ACC deaminase-producing ability exhibited by these PGPR show great promise in ameliorating the effects of heat stress in maize plants. The alleviation of heat stress using ACC deaminase-producing PGPR has been shown in plants such as wheat, which, like maize, is also considered a grain crop (Meena et al., 2015).",

Plants usually increase the activity of these antioxidant enzymes as well as antioxidative compounds, such as ascorbic acid, to alleviate oxidative damage in plant tissues resulting from ROS. However, intense or prolonged heat stress in maize plants reportedly reduces antioxidant activity (Kandel et al., 2018). Amelioration of heat stress mediated by PGPR appears to be associated with reduced ROS accumulation and membrane damage, enhanced chlorophyll content, upregulation of an array of redox enzymes, and accumulation of osmolytes, which improve overall plant thermotolerance (Farooq et al., 2009). One way to mitigate ROS accumulation is to augment the content of phenols, which constitute the non-enzymatic antioxidants of the plant (Vardharajula et al., 2011). Plants can accumulate phenolic compounds in response to heat stress, which are able to scavenge ROS (Soengas et al., 2018). Phenolic compounds help inhibit the action of oxidizing enzymes by forming complexes with metals, which catalyze oxygenation reactions (Król et al., 2014). Heat stress has also been shown to enhance the exogenous production of antioxidants by microorganisms. Bacillus isolates (HT1, HT3, and HT4) and Pseudooceanicola marinus HT2 subjected to heat stress (56 • C) exhibited increased levels of flavonoids and polyphenols in all strains and glutathione in HT2 (Hassan et al., 2020). These microbes also displayed increased CAT, SOD, GPX, and POX activity under heat stress, compared to the control. Additionally, Enterobacter spp. have previously been shown to produce antioxidants, including ascorbic acid (Ghosh et al., 2015). As such, exogenously produced PGPR antioxidants have the potential to reduce oxidative damage in heat-stressed maize. Furthermore, Bacillus safensis, Ochrobactrium pseudogrignonense, and Bacillus cereus have been shown to activate antioxidant signalling in plants under heat stress, leading to enhanced redox enzyme activity (Khan et al., 2020;Mukhtar et al., 2020).",

Furthermore, the characterization of plant physiological responses under heat, drought stress, or their combined effects shows that the combination of stresses presents multiple distinctive aspects. Some of these are the simultaneous occurrence of low photosynthesis with high respiration, and high leaf temperatures with the closing of stomata (Mittler, 2006). There is a strong correlation between the physiological properties and transcriptome profiling of plants subjected to drought or heat stress individually or in combination; however, there is a gap in the literature on how maize plants respond to the combination of drought and heat stresses at the transcriptomic level.

Furthermore, heat stress and combined stress conditions commonly upregulated 36 proteins, of which 20 were HSPs, which included 14 small HSPs (sHSPs).

Moreover, CAT, peroxidase, and APX were most severely reduced under heat stress, followed by under drought and combined drought and heat stresses. This emphasizes the fact that plant molecular and metabolic responses to the combined effects of heat and drought stresses are unique to the responses observed when each of the stresses is applied individually.

          "text": "The knowledge gained over the past decades has helped to understand key features regarding the mode of action of plant-PGPR interactions conferring abiotic stress tolerance of plants, but major knowledge gaps remain. Drought stress effects on plants as well as how PGPR-ameliorated drought stress affects the physiological, growth, developmental, yield, and genetic parameters of maize have been well documented. However, the effects of heat, as a single stress or in combination with drought, on maize are not clear. Likewise, studies demonstrating how PGPR mitigate these stresses in maize plants are scarce.",

          "text": "A plethora of molecular techniques, such as metatranscriptomics, metabolomics, and metaproteomics, are becoming more accessible for monitoring plant responses to abiotic stresses. Furthermore, these techniques are expected to improve tremendously, making it possible to more precisely determine how PGPR induce plant tolerance to drought, heat and their combinatory stresses by influencing plant molecular signalling and stress response pathways. Additionally, stress response genes and proteins such as antioxidant enzymes, heat stress transcription factors, high-and low-molecularweight HSPs, LEA proteins, and dehydrins are critical for maize plants acquiring tolerance to drought, heat, and their combined stresses. As such, investigating how these stress response genes are altered under PGPR-mitigated combined drought and heat stresses should be a priority. This in turn will positively affect agricultural productivity by mitigating the negative effects of climate change in the coming decades. The evaluation of how PGPR imparts drought and heat tolerance to plants is still at its early stages. In essence, PGPR that are capable of inducing plant resistance to combinations of abiotic stresses, especially those that mimic field conditions, should be considered for future research programs that promote sustainable agriculture. Moreover, understanding the relationships between plants, associated microbes, and the environment is a promising approach toward addressing the negative effects of climate change on maize production.",
