However, there is little information about a comprehensive and systematical understanding to identify the critical stage in the response of kernel numbers per spike (KNS) to individual and combined drought and heat stress around flowering. Here we evaluated three successive phases (florets development, florets pollination and seed setting) of kernel set under drought, heat and combined drought and heat stress (DS, HS and DHS) with two maize hybrids using the field site ponds covered with a rain shelter in 2018 and 2019. As an average in two years, KNS was reduced by 18.9 % in DS treatment, 10.8 % in HS treatment and 37.2 % in DHS treatment compared with the control treatment. The most considerable adverse impacts during the three phases were all observed in DHS treatment, followed by DS and HS treatments. Among the three phases, the impact of stress on seed setting was more substantial than that in the other two phases for both hybrids. Kernel abortion was the main reason for the decrease in KNS due to the stress, which resulted from the prevention of sugar-starch conversion. The starch content in the kernel was reduced by 42 % in DS treatment, 29 % in HS treatment and 58 % in DHS treatment on the 8th day after silking. This finding would supply a reference for breeders to evolve strategies in developing stress-resilient and high-yielding hybrids under climate change.",

          "text": "As the leading food crops in the world, maize (Zea mays L.) accounted for 42 % of cereal production (FAO, 2019). Maize yield is frequently limited when suffered from the individual or the combined abiotic stresses in future climates (Lesk et al., 2016). Increases in frequency and magnitude of drought and heat stresses are the prime abiotic constraints that cause considerable adverse effects on maize production (Lobell and Field, 2007;Velde et al., 2010;Hatfield et al., 2011). Maize yield is determined by the harvested kernel numbers per unit land area and average kernel weight. Kernel numbers per spike (KNS) is responsible for most yield variation for a given plant density (Andrade et al., 1999;Borrás and Vitantonio-Mazzini et al., 2018). Understanding the impacts and the underlying mechanism of drought, heat and their combination on kernel set is of utmost importance for guiding maize breeding and management to offset predicted yield losses in the face of climate change.",

          "text": "The KNS is established during the flowering period (Borrás and Vitantonio-Mazzini, 2018). The formation of final KNS needs three consecutive processes (i.e., the florets differentiation, florets pollination and seed setting) (Edreira et al., 2011), all of which are sensitive to abiotic stresses (Hatfield et al., 2011;Prasad et al., 2017). Any one of the above processes suffered from abiotic stresses would lead to decreased kernel numbers (Edreira et al., 2011). Potential KNS is established early during vegetative growth stage (around the eight-leaf stage, Gonzalez et al., 2019). This potential KNS is reduced around flowering during which time plants undergo pivotal growth events such as tassel and silk growth, pollination, fertilization and subsequently seed setting (Sánchez et al., 2014;Shen et al., 2020). Stress factors such as drought and heat around the flowering stage could affect these growth events and contribute to the eventual reproductive failure (Barnabás et al., 2008;Oury et al., 2016b). Although many of studies have focused on one or several processes to determine the final KNS (Edreira et al., 2011;Siebers et al., 2017), there is little information about a comprehensive and systematical understanding to identify the critical stage in the response of maize kernel set with drought and heat stress around flowering.",

          "text": "Some independent studies have demonstrated the effects of drought and heat stress on KNS. Drought stress around flowering reduced the silk and ovary growth rate (Oury et al., 2016a, b), extended anthesis-silking interval (Edmeades et al., 2000;Fuad-hassan et al., 2008), and reduced the silk receptivity (Bassetti and Westgate, 1993). For heat stress, it decreased the ability of pollen germination (Dupuis and Dumas, 1990), pollen tube elongation (Stone, 2001), and altered pollen morphology (i.e., thicker exine wall and disintegrated tapetum layer) (Djanaguiraman et al., 2018). In the maize field, drought and heat stress often occurred in combination (Wang et al., 2018). The simultaneous occurrence of both stresses increased the deleterious effect, such that the effect considerably exceeded the simple additive effects of the action alone (Zandalinas et al., 2018). However, the interactive effects of both stresses around flowering on KNS of maize have received far less attention.",

At present, multiple underlying mechanisms may contribute to the eventual reproductive failure. For example, there are three kinds of explanation about kernel abortion induced by carbon. First, kernel abortion was caused by limited assimilates. In support of this theory, the sucrose fed to stem partially reversed drought-induced kernel abortion because the glucose, starch and glucose gradient was generally distributed in the ovaries (Mclaughlin and Boyer, 2004;Ruan et al., 2010;Shen et al., 2018). Second, kernel abortion occurred because sugar-to-starch synthesis was disturbed even with an adequate sucrose supply (Cheikh and Jones, 1995;Zinselmeier et al., 1999). Third, recent studies have demonstrated that the expansive growth of reproductive organs is the primary event leading to kernel abortion, rather than a disruption of carbon metabolism in mild water deficits (Oury et al., 2016b;Turc and Tardieu, 2018).",

However, the starch content in the kernel was reduced by 42 % in DS treatment, 29 % in HS treatment and 58 % in DHS treatment as an average in two hybrids, which indicated the limitations in the utilization of available sugars in kernels due to stresses. This reduction in the stress may result from the reduced activity of acid invertase and prevented sucrose from being cleaved (Zinselmeier et al., 1999). Furthermore, it can also assume that the activity of enzymes decreased and relative expression level of genes reduced in sucrose and starch turnover (Duke and Doehlert, 1996;Hurkman et al., 2003;Ning et al., 2018). The lower starch granule numbers per endosperm cell and smaller starch granules size in stresses after the fertilization completed further confirmed the view (Fig. 7, Supplemental Fig. S3). In contrast, a previous study showed there was a location along the phloem-endosperm pathway where the sugar flux resulted in a localized depletion and this concentration was what triggered the response (Makela et al., 2005).",

          "text": "The photoassimilate has to travel a long distance from the source to  sink in maize (Ning et al., 2018). Initially, the sucrose in the leaves was diffused to vascular parenchyma cells from bundle sheath through plasmodesmata (Braun and Slewinski, 2009). Then the sucrose is exported from vascular parenchyma cells to the apoplast by SWEETs (Chen and Thelen, 2010). At the last step, the sucrose was retrieved from the apoplast and loaded into phloem companion cells by sucrose transporters (Baker et al., 2016). When the sucrose loaded into the phloem, the long-distance transport can be impaired by callose deposition (Ma et al., 2008). The previous researches indicated that the kernel abortion was due to a decreased assimilate flux toward the ear and slower transfer of photosynthate to the ear (Mclaughlin and Boyer, 2004;Suwa et al., 2010). In the present study, the soluble sugar and 13 C labeled carbohydrate content in the kernel was similar or even higher in DS and HS treatments compared with CK. It can also suggest that the sucrose transport from mesophyll cell to bundle sheath, to vascular parenchyma cells, to phloem was not influenced significantly. For DHS treatment in Zhengdan 958, the lower soluble sugar in the kernel may be due to the decrease of transport from ear pedicel to the kernel because the big vascular bundle area in the ear cob was significantly reduced by 21 % (Fig. 7).",

Meanwhile, we found that silk development is more sensitive to drought while pollen activity is more sensitive to high temperature, which was consistent with Lizaso et al. (2018). This also implicated the future breeding program should be considered according to the different crop growth environment (Siebert and Ewert, 2014).",

First, the number of floret in both hybrids was decreased in DS treatment (Fig. 3). The loss of floret number may be related to inadequate assimilate availability of ear (Borrás and Vitantonio-Mazzini 2018). Second, the number of exposed silk was significantly decreased by in DS treatment but were not significantly affected in HS treatment (Fig. 3). Previous studies found the exposed silk was closely related to KNS (Edreira et al., 2011). The reduction of exposed silk numbers was attributed to reduced silk elongation rate in abiotic stresses (Jacobs and Pearson, 1991;Bassetti and Westgate, 1993). Third, the decrease of the silk growth rate extended the ASI to some extent, and the effect of DS treatment on ASI was higher than HS treatment (Fig. 4B). Therefore, more attention should be paid on biomass partitioning to ear, silk development and ASI for droughttolerant maize hybrid breeding (Cooper et al., 2014).",

          "text": "Equally important, heat is another significant stress to limit crop growth and yield. Many pieces of evidence from wheat and rice showed that extreme heat reduced the reproductive organ viability and disrupted the fertilization process (Saini et al., 1983;Sarwar et al., 2017). We also found that heat had a great impact on pollen viability (Fig. 4D). The decrease of pollen viability under HS treatment resulted from the abnormal development of anthers and pollen grains (Giorno et al., 2013), changed pollen morphology (Firon et al., 2006), and reduced starch content in the pollen (Wang et al., 2019). Meanwhile, heat stress can severely inhibit pollen germination as well as pollen tube growth, and disrupt the fertilization process (Young et al., 2004). Therefore, the maize hybrids growing with a heat environment should pay more attention to pollen viability and fertilization process for breeders. In production, appropriate management measures might be employed to decrease the extent of drought and heat stress in the field (Sacks et al., 2009; Siebert and Ewert, 2012;Sharma et al., 2018;Hunt et al., 2019). For example, the integrated soil-crop system management could mitigate the drought and heat stress for maize production in the current and future climate (Meng et al., 2018).",

In this study, we found that among the three critical phases of kernel development, the third phase, corresponding to seed setting was the main contributor to decreases in final kernel numbers. Furthermore, the kernel abortion in stress can be alleviated through a higher utilization ability for available sugars and starch synthesis at an early stage of seed development. Such the finding in this experiment, along with an effective agronomic management system, would pave the way in developing crop genotypes with improved KNS under drought and heat stress.",
