Maize crops were grown at Balcarce, Argentina during two seasons. Treatments included two water regimes (i.e., rainfed and irrigated) and three plant densities (4, 8 and 12 plants m -2 ). Measurements comprised (i) soil water content and iPAR during the whole growing season, (ii) shoot biomass around silking and (iii) grain yield and shoot biomass at physiological maturity. Crop ET was calculated by means of water balance and soil evaporation was measured with microlysimeters. The response of WUEg to increasing plant density from 4 to 8 or from 4 to 12 plants m -2 was influenced by seasonal water supply. Both seasonal ET and T/ET consistently increased with plant densities across contrasting water regimes. Although increments in T/ET partition were in accordance with increasing iPAR, they did not promote higher WUEg at low water supply. Grain yield increased with plant density, except in the driest environment where no response of either grain yield nor WUEg to plant density was detected. Our results showed that the response of CGRcp to plant density increments (i) depended on the water supply, and (ii) contributed to explain WUEg response to plant density under contrasting water supplies.",

Large grain yield variability across years for rainfed crops were associated with water supply during the maize growing season (Nielsen et al., 2009;Calviño et al., 2003). Therefore, maximizing WUEg is a major target to cope with years with low water supply.",

          "text": "Increasing plant density is a management practice that has the potential of increasing WUEg: in non-water limited environments, higher plant densities promoted larger WUEg in maize (Yao and Shaw, 1964;Timmons et al., 1966;Lamm et al., 2009;Al-Kaisi and Yin, 2003), as well as in other crops (e.g., Echarte et al., 2020). Higher plant densities increase the interception of photosynthetically active radiation per unit area (iPAR; Tetio-Kagho and Gardner, 1988;Andrade et al., 1993;Andrade et al., 2002a). Larger iPAR, in particular during the critical period for kernel set (i.e. 30 days around silking; Tollenaar et al., 1992), are associated with higher grain yields explained by greater crop growth rates (CGRcp) which, in turn, increase kernel number per unit area (Andrade et al., 1999(Andrade et al., , 2002b)). In addition, higher canopy cover are associated with higher transpiration (T) and lower evaporation rates (E; i.e., loss of non-productive water; Ritchie, 1972;Villalobos and Fereres, 1990;Allen et al., 1998). Therefore, larger WUEg at higher plant densities could be the result of (i) an improved ET partition towards productive water use (i.e., higher T/ET ratio) during the growing season, and/or (ii) to greater crop growth capacity, specifically during the critical period for kernel set (i.e., CGRcp).",

Higher plant densities increase ET during the vegetative period (Echarte et al., 2020), which could reduce soil water availability at the beginning of the critical period for kernel set. Then, when water is scarce, high plant densities could increase the likelihood of water deficiencies during the critical period for kernel set.

The soil was a complex of a fine mixed Typic Argiudoll and a fine thermic Petrocalcic Paleudoll (petrocalcic horizon at 170-190 cm), with a loam texture at the surface layer (0-25-cm depth), loam to clayloam at sub-surface layers (25-110-cm depth) and sandy-loam below 110-cm depth (C-horizon) with 5.4% topsoil organic matter. Field capacity was 3.6 mm cm -1 (at -33 kPa pressure) while the permanent wilting point (PWP) was 2 mm cm -1 (at -1500 kPa). The field capacity is a measure of soil ability to retain water after internal drainage has ended (Hillel, 1998) and estimates the upper limit of plant available water (Veihmeyer and Hendrickson, 1950). The permanent wilting point (PWP) is the soil water content below which the plant cannot recover turgidity (Hillel, 1998) and thus represents the lowest limit of plant available water (Veihmeyer and Hendrickson, 1950). Both traits were determined according to Richards and Weaver (1943). Experiments were conducted under conventional tillage and were fertilized with 30 kg P ha -1 at sowing and with 250 kg N ha -1 at V6 stage (Ritchie and Hanway, 1982). Weeds and insects were effectively controlled.",

Subplots comprised six rows, 0.7 m apart and 12 m long. Four additional rows were included in between irrigation and rainfed treatments. In the irrigation treatments, drip irrigation was performed to maintain soil water availability above 50% of soil available water during the entire growing season (Doremboos and Kassam, 1979). Fig. 1 depicts moments of irrigation and amounts of water for the different treatments.
