Furthermore, it was also analysed how the amount of nitrogen and its application time affected the productivity and protein content (GP) of maize under drought stress (DS) and non-stress (NS) conditions. There were seven fertilizer treatments in the scope of the field experiment. Non-fertilized treatment (A 0 ) spring basic treatment with 60 and 120 N ha -1 (A 60 , A 120 ), and following the basic treatments, 30 kg N ha -1 top-dressing was applied in the V6 (V6 90 , V6 150 ) phenophase and then another 30 kg N ha -1 in the V12 (V12 120 , V12 180 ) phenophase. Based on the GDD and PTU, length of the vegetation period of maize hybrids can be predicted. Under DS, the largest GY and GP was recorded in the same treatment for Sushi (V6 150 kg N ha -1 ), and at different nutrient levels under NS: GY (A 120 ) and GP (V6 150 ). The highest GY of Fornad hybrid under DS was achieved with the A 120 treatment while the highest GP with the V6 150 ; in the case of NS V6 150 kg N ha -1 was the most effective for both GY and GP. The + 30 kg ha -1 N fertilizer applied in the V12 phenophase did not improve GY and GP in either hybrid during the two growing seasons. The findings provide useful help for farmers to prepare for future environmental changes and to operate successfully.",

It is also a key component of animal feed (Shiferaw et al., 2011;Malaviarachchi et al., 2014) and its role in human nutrition is also extremely important. Of the 300,000 edible plant species, 200 are consumed, of which maize, wheat and rice make up 60% of the diet. In countries struggling with hunger, 80-90% of maize is used for human consumption. Therefore, increasing the average yield, yield stability and quality of maize is of utmost importance.",

Achieving a certain heat unit accumulation is required to reach each phenological stage of maize hybrids (Nandini & Sridhara, 2019;Ahmed & Saikia, 2020). The duration of phenophases determines the rate and distribution of dry matter accumulation in different parts of the plant (Hao et al., 2016;Mirosavljević et al., 2018;Shrestha et al., 2018) Temperature-based agrometeorological indices of (GDD, HTU, PTU, and HYTU) are widely used for plant growth, phenological development, and harvest time estimation (Rajput et al., 1987;Wurr et al., 2002;Roy et al., 2005). These indices are based on the idea that the rate of phenological development is linearly related to temperature in the range between base temperature and optimal temperature (Monteith, 1981). Quantifying heat use efficiency (HUE) is useful for assessing the yield potential of a plant in different environments (Singh et al., 2018). Even under the most favourable agro-climatic conditions, the total heat and radiation energy available to the plant is not completely converted to dry matter. HUE depends on sowing time, genetic factors, and the applied agro-technology (Rao et al., 1999;Rani et al., 2012).",

In the case of the Fornad hybrid, the lowest applied base treatment of 60 kg N ha -1 (A 60 ) (P < 0.01) and the V6 90 N ha -1 (P < 0.001) treatment resulted in a yield increase of 21-21% under NS conditions. In the case of the Sushi hybrid, the effect of NS was significant in the A 120 treatment (19.7%, (P < 0.001)). Utilization of the fertilizers applied in the V6 and V12 phenological phases was not significantly helped by NS. In the control treatment, the heat utilization efficiency of the Sushi hybrid was 42% higher under NS conditions than in the drought stress (DS) crop year. Due to the higher heat sum in the NS crop year, this increase is below the increase of natural nutrient utilization capacity. In the case of the Fornad hybrid, due to the nearly identical heat sum of the two crop years, the 29% difference in HUE is essentially the same as the difference in yield averages. Mainly due to the more favourable water supply, HYTU was 11-12% higher in the NS growing season than in the DS growing season. Consequently, HYTUE differs by 32% in the two crop years in the non-fertilized treatments of Sushi and by 20% in the treatments of the Fornad hybrid, which is significantly below the differences in the average yield. Under more favourable conditions, heat efficiency is higher, but not as much as the increase in natural nutrient utilization.",

In the two years of the experiment, the values of PTU for the growing season were also almost the same in the two years, the differences (Sushi hybrid 2.6%, Fornad hybrid 0.9%) were significantly lower than the relative differences in the number of growing days. Consistent with the conclusion of Malo & Ghosh (2018), the findings suggest that this agrometeorological index may also be suitable for estimating the length of the phenological phase in the case of maize. However, the limited validity and applicability of PTU remains, as it does not take into account the change in photoperiodic sensitivity over time, the critical length of day, or even significant differences in sensitivity between genotypes. More complex, well-parameterizable formulas than PTU can be used to describe the combined effect of photoperiod and temperature (Birch et al., 1998;Yan et al., 1998;Bonhomme, 2000). Large differences in HTU and HYTU units (7-12%) between the two growing seasons suggest that they are not suitable for estimating the length of phenological phases.",
